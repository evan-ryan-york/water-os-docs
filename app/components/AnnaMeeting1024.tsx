          <div className="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-1">Ryan</div>
          <div className="text-gray-900">How are you doing today?</div>
        </div>

          <div className="font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-1">Anna</div>
          <div className="text-gray-900">I&apos;m doing fine. Yourself?</div>

          <div className="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-1">Ryan</div>
          <div className="text-gray-900">I&apos;m doing well. I&apos;m doing well. Excited to get a chance to connect and learn more.</div>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 rounded-lg p-3 w-3/4">
          <div className="font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-1">Anna</div>
          <div className="text-gray-900">Yes.</div>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg p-3 w-3/4 ml-auto">
          <div className="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-1">Ryan</div>
          <div className="text-gray-900">Good. So how&apos;s the last few days been? How&apos;s sort of getting things started then for you?</div>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 rounded-lg p-3 w-3/4">
          <div className="font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-1">Anna</div>
          <div className="text-gray-900">Okay. So for my side, I&apos;ve been trying to get the people from the various categories, and I have gotten a few contacts that we can start with. With some of them, we&apos;ve scheduled interviews for next week. So for my side, we are on it.</div>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg p-3 w-3/4 ml-auto">
          <div className="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-1">Ryan</div>
          <div className="text-gray-900">That&apos;s great. Have you found...</div>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 rounded-lg p-3 w-3/4">
          <div className="font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-1">Anna</div>
          <div className="text-gray-900">My only challenge is with the businesses. I&apos;m not really getting, but today I was supposed to step outside and go around and check if I could speak to some of them if they were really in need of... if they have the water issue as we are discussing. But I had an emergency at home, so I couldn&apos;t go. So I&apos;ll do that tomorrow morning, God willing. Yes, I&apos;ll do that.</div>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg p-3 w-3/4 ml-auto">
          <div className="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-1">Ryan</div>
          <div className="text-gray-900">Got it. Hopefully everything&apos;s okay. Are you finding specific truck drivers or owners or depot workers? Are there certain people that are reluctant to talk or don&apos;t want to talk to you? Or in general, when you reach out, are people pretty open to having a conversation?</div>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 rounded-lg p-3 w-3/4">
          <div className="font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-1">Anna</div>
          <div className="text-gray-900">No. People are pretty open to have the conversation, especially for the residential purchasers. Because it&apos;s a major concern to them. And with a few of them I spoke to, their issue was with even sometimes getting the truck driver to bring the water on time. Yes. So for the residential people, most of the people I spoke to, they are really opened up for the discussion. So it&apos;s a good thing on our side. Yes.</div>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg p-3 w-3/4 ml-auto">
          <div className="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-1">Ryan</div>
          <div className="text-gray-900">Got it. Okay, well, great. Well, good work going ahead and getting a few scheduled. That&apos;s awesome. I had a couple of questions that I was curious, and this is more anecdotal just in terms of what you&apos;ve heard and experienced from people you know or just been living there.</div>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 rounded-lg p-3 w-3/4">
          <div className="font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-1">Anna</div>
          <div className="text-gray-900">Okay?</div>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg p-3 w-3/4 ml-auto">
          <div className="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-1">Ryan</div>
          <div className="text-gray-900">So not from anyone specific type of person, but just generally speaking, are there certain trends that you find that are just like common frustrations or like biggest pain points for people just when dealing with getting water?</div>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 rounded-lg p-3 w-3/4">
          <div className="font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-1">Anna</div>
          <div className="text-gray-900">I think so. As I said earlier, I think the pain point here is even getting the truck driver to bring the water is a problem for them. So they have to call about two to three drivers at the same time. The one who comes home first is the one they will buy the water from. Then they have to call the other two and tell them. Yes, because you may call someone. The person is like, I&apos;m coming. I&apos;ll be there in the next two hours. In the next two hours, the person hasn&apos;t come, so they have to call about two to three people so that first come, first serve - the one who comes first will be the one they would buy from. So that has been the conversation. And I think also right now with the issue of the galamsey, as I was telling you about, is really affecting a lot of the waters. And currently we have this outbreak of flu in Ghana.</div>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg p-3 w-3/4 ml-auto">
          <div className="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-1">Ryan</div>
          <div className="text-gray-900">Oh. Wow.</div>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 rounded-lg p-3 w-3/4">
          <div className="font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-1">Anna</div>
          <div className="text-gray-900">A lot of... in my house, I have three people who have contracted it.</div>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg p-3 w-3/4 ml-auto">
          <div className="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-1">Ryan</div>
          <div className="text-gray-900">Oh, no.</div>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 rounded-lg p-3 w-3/4">
          <div className="font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-1">Anna</div>
          <div className="text-gray-900">I hear it&apos;s an infection in the water that we are drinking and all of that. So I think it&apos;s a big issue for people now. So the problem now is even getting the people to bring the water. And now even when the tap comes, the Ghana Water Company opens the tap, the water is not clean. So people still end up on some of the bottled water and the sachet water. One I spoke to told me his house, they don&apos;t drink the pipe water anymore. They now have to rely on the bottled water. So now they call the companies that they know that they distill the water to bring them water because they don&apos;t trust the tap that flows at home again. So I think that has been a challenge. And also one thing I realized that people are now also getting boreholes in their houses. Two of the people I spoke to, they&apos;ve dug borehole because their water isn&apos;t reliable. So they had to look for an alternative. And now they sell the borehole water to the other community people too. So that&apos;s another thing that is also rising from everything that is going on.</div>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg p-3 w-3/4 ml-auto">
          <div className="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-1">Ryan</div>
          <div className="text-gray-900">Yeah. Do people generally when thinking about the water company, do people generally just across the city, what have you found to be people&apos;s attitude about the water company? Is it like they&apos;re doing the best they can, or are people really pissed at them? What&apos;s the vibe?</div>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 rounded-lg p-3 w-3/4">
          <div className="font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-1">Anna</div>
          <div className="text-gray-900">People are actually angry. So if you go on the news, especially people in the Densu constituency, it&apos;s terrible. Because sometimes in two weeks before the tap starts flowing, in 14 days, the tap is just coming once in 14 days. It&apos;s a bit frustrating knowing that you use the water to bathe, to wash, to cook, to flush the washroom and everything. So it&apos;s a bit of a challenge for them. And people are really angry at Ghana Water. And the conversation going around is the country doesn&apos;t want to allow private investors to also have a share of providing water for people. So now people have to now rely on private companies that provide water through the trucks or the depots or... Yeah, because now in Ghana, we just have one company that supplies the whole country with about more than 40 million population with water and it&apos;s stressful. So I think there was a conversation I was watching where they were saying they should allow foreign investors who have the capacity to bring in equipment to also provide water for some of these people. But it looks like it&apos;s not a conversation the government wants to have. So the people now have to rely on this truck drivers, other water depot people, and the borehole, as I was telling you now, people have to depend on that now.</div>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg p-3 w-3/4 ml-auto">
          <div className="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-1">Ryan</div>
          <div className="text-gray-900">Yeah.</div>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 rounded-lg p-3 w-3/4">
          <div className="font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-1">Anna</div>
          <div className="text-gray-900">So people are actually angry and frustrated at Ghana Water Company.</div>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-gray-100 rounded-lg p-3 w-3/4 ml-auto">
          <div className="font-semibold text-gray-700 mb-1">Ryan</div>
          <div className="text-gray-900">Mm hmm. Do you know what the government&apos;s concern is? Why they don&apos;t want to... like, what&apos;s the argument against letting other people do it?</div>
        </div>

        <div className="bg-blue-50 rounded-lg p-3 w-3/4">
          <div className="font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-1">Anna</div>
          <div className="text-gray-900">I don&apos;t know the details, but from what I&apos;ve heard from the conversation, I think they are trying to say that water is a national resource, so they wouldn&apos;t want private people to benefit. So that&apos;s the whole conversation going on. But for me, I think if you are opening it up for private investors, of course they are profiting from it, but then they are solving a problem in the country. It&apos;s actually a help to the government. So why not have the conversation? Because if you as a government cannot do the simple provision of water, then you can bring in people who have the resources and also solve the problem. And because if you look at the telecommunication in Ghana, we&apos;ve also allowed private investors to come in and everyone is doing so well. If you didn&apos;t allow the MTNs, the Airtel-Tigos, the Vodafones to come in, we wouldn&apos;t have our telecommunication system very, very okay. So I think that&apos;s just the thing. So they say water is a national resource. So private people shouldn&apos;t benefit from it at the detriment of the people. That&apos;s what I&apos;m hearing.</div>
