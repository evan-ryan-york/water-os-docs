Current Mission
Founder, Water OS: Building the operating system for universal water access. A 20-year vision to directly serve 25-40M people and enable access for 200-500M more through a global technology platform. The initial wedge is a capital-light, three-sided marketplace in Accra, Ghana.

Chief Product & Technology Officer, Willow Education (Jan 2024-Present): As the sole product manager and engineer, he solo-built a 200,000 LOC production codebase in one year, scaling from a single pilot to 50 schools and 10,000 weekly active users. He managed 500% user growth in his first 90 days with 100% platform uptime.

Core Capabilities
Technical Excellence

Expert Software Developer: 8 years building React/Node/Typescript SPAs; now tech-stack agnostic.

Agentic AI Mastery: Deploys a sophisticated Claude Code orchestration with 8 specialized sub-agents, DAGs, and MCPs for high-velocity, parallel software development.

Production at Scale: Has designed, built, and deployed 11 web applications serving a combined 100,000+ users.

Operational Leadership

Co-Founder/Co-CEO, The Gathering Place: Scaled a public charter school from $0 to $10MM in revenue, serving 700 students with over 200 staff.

Flawless Fiscal Management: Solely managed the nearly $10MM budget, receiving A+ exemplary state audits every year.

Proven Scaler: Grew the RePublic CS curriculum from 3 schools to 150 schools across 13 states in just two years.

Infrastructure Projects: Led the $25MM facility acquisition through the bond market, managing all construction, logistics, and operations.

Strategic Thinking

System Architect: Sees interlocking problems and designs sequential solutions that build power and leverage over time ("Flywheel Thinking").

Decision Framework: Exhaustively collects information from data and experts, then trusts his own judgment for the final call.

Leadership & Values
Management Style

Direction Setter, Not Micromanager: "I tell you where we're going, not how to get there."

Socratic Coach: Asks questions to develop team members' own problem-solving abilities.

"Clear is Kind": Employs direct, data-driven, and humane performance management.

Hires For: Curiosity, a personal connection to the mission, a love of hard work, and the ability to execute independently.

Core Values (In Priority Order): Impact, Equity, Innovation, Continuous Learning, Independence.

Strengths & Weaknesses
Key Strengths

Full-Stack Operator: Moves fluidly from high-level strategy → operations → code.

Thrives in 0-to-1 Chaos: Imposes elegant, scalable systems on messy environments.

Polymath Fluency: Expert across technology, business, finance, and education.

Inspiring in Groups: A strong and persuasive communicator at scale.

Known Weaknesses (Areas for Delegation)

Can go straight to problem-solving instead of listening first; weaker in 1:1 sales contexts.

High intensity during problem-solving can feel like an attack to others.

Can get too "in the weeds" and take on too much himself due to a love for building.

Tends to underinvest time in external-facing work like networking and sector monitoring.

Definitions of Success & Failure
Definition of Success: Creating a self-sustaining engine of impact that reaches "escape velocity," allowing him to build an "empire of innovations" that solve problems rooted in inequity. Financial success is purely instrumental.

Definition of Failure: Not bankruptcy or a failed startup. Failure is a failure of scale and courage—remaining a capable operator on someone else's smaller mission instead of testing the upper limit of his own capacity for impact.
