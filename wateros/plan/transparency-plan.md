# Customer-Facing Transparency Plan
**Version:** 1.1 | **Last Updated:** 2025-11-26

## 1. Guiding Philosophy

Our core differentiator is **Trust**. In a market where trust is the scarcest resource, we will win by being radically transparent. We do not make impossible promises. We do not say "our water is 100% pure."

Instead, our message is: **"We are the only platform that verifies every single delivery. We show you the proof."**

## 2. Core Marketing Message

**Slogan**: Clearwater: The 3-Layer Trust Check™

**Elevator Pitch**: "We know how hard it is to trust water quality in Accra. That's why we built a new system. We're the only platform that performs a 3-Layer Trust Check: we lab-test every depot before they join, we run an instant 3-point field test on every fill-up, and we run constant, random lab audits for invisible threats like E. coli and heavy metals. We don't just promise—we verify."

### Our 3-Layer Trust Check™

In a market with no transparency, we decided to build it. Every single water delivery on our platform must pass our **3-Layer Trust Check**. Here's how it works.

---

#### Layer 1: We Vet Every Water Source

Before a depot can sell a single drop of water on our platform, our team performs a rigorous inspection.

- **Full Lab Certification**: We take a sample of their water and send it to an independent, accredited lab (like SGS Ghana) to test for a full panel of invisible threats, including E. coli, lead, and arsenic.

- **Source Vetting**: We ensure the depot uses a protected borehole or municipal source. We blacklist all depots that use untreated surface water (like from the Weija Lake) due to high contamination risks.

**Result**: Only depots that pass this comprehensive certification are activated.

---

#### Layer 2: We Test Every Single Fill-Up. Instantly.

This is our real-time protection. Water quality can change, especially after a heavy rain. We catch these changes before the truck leaves the depot.

- **Mandatory Field Test**: Every time your driver fills their tanker, they are required by our app to run an instant, 3-point field test using a digital meter.

**The 3-Point Check**:
1. **Turbidity**: Checks for silt, sand, or "cloudiness."
2. **TDS (Total Dissolved Solids)**: Checks for spikes in salinity (salt) or other dissolved chemicals.
3. **ATP (Biologicals)**: Checks the total "microbiological load" to see if the water is clean.

**Result**: If the water fails any of these three tests, the app blocks the delivery and the driver is sent to a different approved source.

---

#### Layer 3: We Run Constant, Random Lab Audits

We trust, but we verify. Our Operations Manager is always in the field running surprise checks to police the network.

- **Driver Audits**: We randomly intercept drivers at their delivery point and re-run the 3-point test with our own calibrated meters to ensure their data is honest.

- **Lab Audits**: We take samples from trucks and send them back to the lab for the two most critical tests:
  - 18-Hour E. coli Test
  - Heavy Metals Test (Arsenic, Lead)

**Result**: Any driver or depot that fails our audits is immediately suspended or permanently banned from the platform.

---

### Our Commitment to Honesty (What We Don't Promise)

We want to be radically transparent about what our system can and cannot do.

- No "instant" test can detect every single contaminant (like specific dissolved metals) in real-time. That technology doesn't exist yet.

- That is why we don't rely on just one test. Our **Layer 2 Instant Test** catches the most common daily problems (silt, salt, high biological activity). Our **Layer 1 and Layer 3 Lab Audits** are designed specifically to catch the invisible, long-term threats (E. coli, lead, arsenic).

- We cannot promise "100% purity." We can promise that **we are the only service in Accra that is this rigorous, this transparent, and this committed to verifying the quality of every single delivery**.
