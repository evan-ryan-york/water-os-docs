The Agentic Workflow System
Ryan has developed one of the most sophisticated personal agentic development systems documented, allowing him to work at 10x speed with maintained quality:
Architecture Overview:

Foundation Layer: Golden Path Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation explaining key architectures and systems within codebase
Includes: golden path, data schemas, testing strategy, deployment procedures, coding standards
These documents serve as the knowledge base for all agents


Primary Orchestrator Agent

Dedicated agent that helps build technical specifications and PRDs for new features
Uses Claude Code as the orchestration engine
Coordinates all sub-agents through defined workflows


8 Specialized Sub-Agents

Each agent has clear, defined role in development process
Roles include: context gatherer, builder, planner, tester, reviewer, etc.
Each agent has specific input/output JSON/XML formats
Python scripts verify format compliance, ensuring quality control


DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) Files

Define exact operational sequence for orchestrator
Ensure consistent, repeatable workflows
Prevent circular dependencies and ensure proper agent sequencing


MCPs (Model Context Protocols) as Tools

Various agents have access to different MCPs as tools
Enables parallel feature development
Allows simultaneous bug fixing and refactoring/migrations
Dramatically increases throughput without sacrificing quality



Impact:

Can build with any tech stack, not just React/Node
Parallel development of multiple features simultaneously
Maintains high code quality through automated verification
Reduces manual context-switching and increases flow state

This system represents a competitive moat: Ryan can build as fast as a small team while maintaining the coherence of a single architect's vision.

3. Leadership & Management Philosophy
Core Management Principles
"I tell you where we're going, not how to get there"
Ryan's leadership style is characterized by direction-setting combined with radical autonomy for execution:
Direction Setter, Not Micromanager:

Establishes clear vision, goals, and constraints
Provides context and strategic direction
Lets team members determine their own path to objectives
Does not tell people how to do their jobs

Question-Asker & Coach:

Very skilled at asking questions that prompt reflection
Uses Socratic method to develop critical thinking in team members
Creates space for people to arrive at their own insights
Believes in teaching people to fish, not feeding them fish

Performance Management: "Clear is Kind"
Ryan practices direct, data-driven performance management with humanity:
Case Study - The Principal (TGP):

Hired principal who struggled to meet KPIs
Quarterly reviews with clear data on performance gaps
Increased meeting cadence to provide more support
Co-developed high-leverage skills together
After 3 quarters, formal performance evaluation with Action Plan
Plan was aligned to areas of growth already discussed
Principal agreed plan was fair
She ultimately stepped down (right decision)
They remain friends today

This case demonstrates Ryan's ability to maintain relationships while holding high standards. "Clear is kind" means direct feedback is more respectful than vague disappointment.
Hiring Philosophy
Three Non-Negotiables:

Curiosity: People who genuinely want to learn more about whatever they're working on
Personal Connection to Mission: Alignment isn't just professional—it's personal
Love of Hard Work: Not burnout-inducing grind, but genuine passion where work feels like play

Autonomy as Filter:

Looks for people who work well independently
Wants team members who can take direction and figure out the path
Values self-starters who don't need hand-holding

Culture Goal:

Not a burnout factory
But also not a "work-life balance" consulting firm
Seeks aligned, passionate people who love the work so much they don't want to stop
When you love what you're building, 60-hour weeks feel different than when you don't

Conflict Resolution Style
Approach: Direct, Data-Driven, Focused on Problem Not Person

Very direct communication style
Uses data and KPIs to ground difficult conversations
Stays focused on the problem, not the person
Intensity to solve problems can sometimes feel like attacks, especially if someone feels responsible
Has learned to separate behavior from identity

Area for Growth:

Can go straight to problem-solving mode instead of listening first
Spends more time on analytical than emotional processing
Working on creating space for empathy before solutions


4. Decision-Making Framework & Risk Profile
Decision-Making Process
"Analytical + Expert Consultation + Gut Trust"
When facing major decisions (like the $25M facility purchase at TGP):
Step 1: Data Collection & Analysis

Exhaustively researches the question
Always goes back to budget and timeline to keep track of what's possible
Uses data to minimize unknowns
Creates financial models and scenario planning

Step 2: Expert Consultation

Talks to domain experts
Builds small circle of trusted advisors
Actively seeks perspectives that challenge his assumptions

Step 3: Listen & Decide

After collecting information, listens to his small circle
When there aren't clear answers, trusts himself to make final decision
Does not delegate ultimate responsibility

Key Characteristic: Ryan is comfortable making decisions under uncertainty. He doesn't need perfect information—he needs sufficient information to act.
Risk Tolerance: 10/10
Ryan has maximum risk tolerance for ventures aligned with his values:
Evidence:

Left stable career in education to build Willow solo
Willing to relocate to Accra, Ghana for Water OS
Starting Water OS with zero capital, no sector expertise, no connections
Reported TGP to state authorities knowing it would destroy his own company

Important Nuance:
This is not recklessness. Ryan takes calculated risks with high upside and acceptable downside. He mitigates risk through:

Extensive research and planning
Building systems that can adapt
Starting with capital-light approaches
Proving models before scaling

What Qualifies as "Acceptable Downside":

Financial loss (bankruptcy is survivable)
Reputational risk in pursuit of equity
Personal sacrifice (time, money, relationships)

What Does NOT Qualify:

Compromising core values (equity, integrity)
Harming vulnerable populations
Building unsustainable systems

Defining Success and Failure
Success = Creating Self-Sustaining Engine of Impact
Success is NOT:

Personal wealth accumulation
Prestige or recognition
Empire-building for its own sake

Success IS:

Building Water OS to reach "escape velocity"
Creating the conditions for universal water access within one generation
Using profits to fund an "empire of innovations" solving problems rooted in inequity
Spending rest of life in his sweet spot: 0-to-1 system building

Failure = Failure of Scale and Courage
Failure is NOT:

Bankruptcy
A failed startup
Project setbacks or pilots that don't work

Failure IS:

Remaining a highly capable operator on someone else's smaller mission
Getting distracted by projects that are merely interesting or financially safe
Risk aversion preventing the committed leap into his life's work
Ending career having never tested upper limit of his extraordinary capacity for impact

On "Good Failures":
"Really, failure will be quitting. There will be plenty of small failures along the way, battles I'll lose, but the war is just with myself."
This reveals Ryan's mindset: tactical failures are learning opportunities. Strategic failure is abandoning the mission.

5. Core Values & Guiding Principles
The Five Core Values (In Priority Order)
1. Impact
"I don't just want to work hard—I want my work to matter."

Feels most proud when building something that changes trajectories
Not satisfied with surface-level wins or vanity metrics
Wants to create tools, platforms, and experiences that genuinely improve lives
Measures success by outcomes in the real world, not outputs

Application to Water OS: This explains why Water OS is compelling—it's not just a technically interesting problem, it's a problem where impact is measured in millions of lives transformed.
2. Equity
"Equity is a constant undercurrent in my thinking."

Cares deeply about fairness and dismantling systems that marginalize
Always asking: "Who does this help? Who does it leave out? How can we do better?"
Believes best work should create opportunity, not reinforce privilege
Not just about equality of outcome—about removing structural barriers

The Defining Moment: When forced to choose between protecting his company and protecting vulnerable students at TGP, he chose students without hesitation. This wasn't a decision—it was an expression of identity.
Application to Water OS: The water crisis is fundamentally a crisis of inequity. That 2-4 billion people lack reliable access to water is both a moral catastrophe and an economic failure. Ryan sees this as a poverty tax that keeps billions trapped.
3. Innovation
"I'm most alive when I'm making something that hasn't existed before—especially when others think it can't be done."

Career defined by creating things that challenge norms
Gets deep satisfaction from stepping into the unknown and building something elegant
Innovation is how he expresses creativity and purpose simultaneously

Evidence:

Built CS curriculum and LMS that served 10,000+ students (didn't exist before)
Created charter school from nothing
Solo-built 200,000 LOC platform at Willow
Now attempting to build Water OS from zero

4. Continuous Learning
"I have an insatiable appetite for learning. It's not just something I do—it's part of who I am."

Taught himself to code while running schools
Dove into product and technology leadership without a roadmap
Now learning about desalination systems and autonomous robotics
Doesn't wait to be taught—seeks, explores, builds, iterates

Learning Style:

Active, project-based learning
Learns by building
Uses AI as learning accelerant
Sees expertise as a moving target, not a destination

Application to Water OS: Ryan has zero water sector expertise today. He's comfortable with this because he's proven he can rapidly climb learning curves in complex domains.
5. Independence
"Independence allows me to maintain integrity in my decisions, take risks others might avoid, and trust my instincts when I see a better way forward."

Found greatest fulfillment forging his own path
Needs space to think, create, and act freely
Values collaboration but requires autonomy
Not driven by desire to be left alone—driven by need for self-direction

Important Nuance: Ryan is not a lone wolf. He builds teams and collaborates. But he needs to be the architect setting direction.

6. Personal Operating System
Work Capacity & Sustainability
Work Hours:

Comfortable working 80-100 hour weeks when in deep-build phase
These hours are sustainable because he loves the work
Goes to bed thinking about work
Usually doesn't use alarm—wakes naturally when adequately rested because excited to get back to work

This is not burnout-inducing because:

The work itself is energizing
Feels like play, not labor
Aligned with core values and mission
Sees tangible progress daily

Health & Wellness
Despite intense work schedule, Ryan maintains strong health practices:

Sleep: Typically 7 hours per night
Nutrition: Eats well, no smoking
Exercise: Gym 2-3 times per week
Activity: 5,000-10,000 steps daily

This demonstrates sustainable high performance, not manic bursts followed by crashes.
Energy Management
Sources of Energy:

Building and seeing systems come to life
Solving complex problems
Learning new domains rapidly
Seeing measurable impact from his work
Working with aligned, passionate team members

Energy Drains:

Repetitive work without learning
Bureaucracy without purpose
Work misaligned with values
Sectors/roles where he's not building systems

Current Life Context

Age: 40 years old
Location: Currently San Antonio, TX
Relocation Plans: Preparing to relocate to Accra, Ghana in coming months for Water OS Phase 1
Financial Position: Current salary from Willow, targeting $150-300K savings by Month 30-36 of Water OS plan


7. Strengths & Competitive Advantages
Polymath Fluency
Ryan operates across multiple domains with genuine expertise:

Music (built recording studio, ran arts center)
Code (expert software developer)
Mathematics (taught 7th-8th grade math, analytical thinking)
Education (18 years teacher to CEO)
Operations (managed 200+ staff, $10MM budgets)
Business (started 4 businesses)

Why This Matters: Most founders excel in one domain. Ryan can speak the language of engineers, operators, financiers, and policy-makers fluently.
Full-Stack Capability
Can operate at every level:

Strategic Vision: 20-year plans with phase-gated logic
Operational Execution: Budgets, logistics, HR, facilities
Technical Implementation: Writes production code himself

Why This Matters for Water OS: The water sector needs someone who can simultaneously navigate utility politics, architect software platforms, and manage field operations.
0-to-1 System Building
Thrives in chaos and ambiguity:

Pattern: Takes messy, broken environments and imposes elegant, scalable systems
Examples:

Built CS platform from nothing → 150 schools in 2 years
Co-founded charter school → $10MM operation
Solo-built Willow → 200K LOC serving 10K users
Now: Building Water OS from zero capital, no sector expertise



Why This Matters: Water OS Phases 1-3 are pure 0-to-1 work in unfamiliar territory. This is Ryan's superpower.
Execution Bias
Obsessive learner with intense work ethic:

Works 80-100 hours when needed
Learns by building, not by reading
Rapid iteration and deployment
Uses AI as personal leverage multiplier

The Agentic Advantage:
Ryan's sophisticated agentic workflow system means he can build as fast as a small team. This is a genuine competitive moat in early stages.
Mission-Driven with Business Discipline
The Charter School Insight:
Ryan learned that mission-driven work requires profitable, sustainable business models. Charity patches holes; business rebuilds systems.
He believes deeply in equity AND knows only self-sustaining economic engines can achieve impact at scale.
Why This Matters for Water OS: Many social enterprises fail because they're either too mission-focused (unsustainable) or too profit-focused (lose mission). Ryan holds both simultaneously.
Inspiring at Scale
Strong persuader in groups:

Won Sally Ride national award (outcompeting thousands)
Secured $3M in philanthropic funding
Convinced district to adopt CS curriculum district-wide
Built strategic partnerships across multiple states

Group Communication: Ryan is most effective in 1-to-many contexts—presentations, workshops, pitches. He can inspire and persuade audiences.

8. Weaknesses & Development Areas
Reading People (Subtle/Non-Verbal Cues)
Self-Assessment: "I'm not always great at reading people, especially subtle and non-verbal cues."
Impact:

Weaker in 1:1 sales contexts until relationship is established
May miss underlying concerns or emotions in conversations
Can take time to build trust in new relationships

Mitigation Strategies:

Excels once relationship is established
Strong in group contexts where he can read energy collectively
Can compensate by being direct and asking explicit questions

Implication for Water OS:

Will need strong relationship managers for 1:1 sales (depot owners, drivers)
His strength in inspiring groups makes him excellent for B2B anchor clients and policy work
Should hire for interpersonal/relationship skills on team

Listening vs. Problem-Solving
Self-Assessment: "I spend more time on the analytical than the emotional. I've heard plenty of times that I tried to go straight into problem solving instead of listening."
Pattern:

Natural tendency to jump to solutions
Analytical processing prioritized over emotional processing
Can miss the need to simply be heard before being helped

Impact:

Team members may feel unheard
Can damage trust if someone needs empathy before solutions
May miss important context that comes from deeper listening

Growth Area:

Actively working on creating space for empathy before solutions
Aware of the pattern and trying to catch himself

Implication for Water OS:

Benefits from having emotionally-intelligent leadership team members
Should have trusted advisors who will tell him "they need you to listen, not fix"

Intensity & Directness
Self-Assessment: "I can be too direct sometimes. My intensity to solve problems can feel like attacks, especially if someone is feeling responsible."
Pattern:

High standards combined with direct communication
Focused intently on the problem
Can come across as aggressive when passionate about solving issue

Mitigation:

Has learned to stay focused on problem, not person
"Clear is kind" philosophy helps frame directness as respect
Maintains relationships (still friends with principal he managed out)

Growth Area:

Needs to modulate intensity based on situation
Can benefit from pausing to check emotional temperature in room

Implication for Water OS:

Important to build culture where direct feedback is normalized
May need buffer/translator for highly political or sensitive stakeholder relationships
This intensity is also a strength—drives urgency and quality

Getting Too in the Weeds
Self-Assessment: "Sometimes I get too in the weeds, and have a hard time keeping the simplest 'truths' in mind."
Pattern:

Deep analytical mind that wants to understand every detail
Can lose sight of first principles when deep in complexity
May over-optimize or over-engineer when simple solution exists

Impact:

Can slow down decision-making
May miss obvious solutions while pursuing perfect ones
Can overwhelm others with detail

Mitigation:

Needs trusted advisors who will ground him
Benefits from regular "zoom out" check-ins
Can use frameworks and systems to force simplification

Implication for Water OS:

Water OS has 20 interlocking barriers—high risk of getting lost in complexity
Needs to maintain discipline around sequential flywheel logic
Should have co-founder or advisor whose role includes "keep it simple"

Doing vs. Delegating
Self-Assessment: "I also will take on too much myself because I love doing the work, and I don't spend enough time on the parts of the role that are important, but I enjoy doing less (staying up-to-date on the sector, networking, etc)."
Pattern:

Genuine love of execution makes delegation difficult
Prefers building to networking
Underinvests in relationship-building and sector monitoring

Impact:

Doesn't scale himself as effectively as he could
May miss important sector developments or partnership opportunities
Can become bottleneck

Growth Area:

This is classic founder challenge
Needs to build systems that force him into strategic work
Should schedule dedicated time for networking/sector monitoring
May benefit from Chief of Staff role to manage his time

Implication for Water OS:

Phases 1-2: His love of execution is perfect—needs to build himself
Phases 3-5: Will need to actively fight urge to stay hands-on
Should plan for role evolution and hire for skills he underinvests in


9. The Water OS Mission & 20-Year Strategy
The Core Thesis
"The water crisis is not a technical or resource problem—it's a systemic failure of governance, finance, and operations."
Water OS will solve it by:

Proving that last-mile water access is a profitable, bankable asset class
Building the technology that makes operational excellence scalable
Mobilizing private capital at unprecedented scale
Using hard-won credibility to reform the policies that perpetuate failure

The 20 Interlocking Barriers
Ryan has identified 20 specific barriers organized into three categories:
Foundational Barriers (Deep structural problems):

Dysfunctional political economy of water tariffs (below cost-recovery)
Pervasive corruption throughout value chain
Weak and politicized institutions lacking autonomy
Massive capital financing gap ($140B annually)

Systemic Consequences (Infrastructure and operational failures):
5. Build-Neglect-Rebuild cycle (O&M starvation)
6. Non-Revenue Water hemorrhaging 30-50% of production
7. Elite capture at all governance levels
8. Intermittent supply and pressure-driven contamination
9. Fragmented and uncoordinated governance
10. Last-mile connection economics ($300-1,500 barrier)
11. Inefficient and inequitable subsidy schemes
12. Technology-context mismatch and supply chain fragility
13. Unreliable energy supply for water operations
Compounding Factors (Social and environmental pressures):
14. Climate change and environmental degradation
15. Ineffective water quality enforcement
16. Extreme household poverty and affordability constraints
17. Systematic marginalization and social exclusion
18. Land tenure insecurity and rapid urbanization
19. Rural-urban disparity in service and investment
20. Low public awareness, demand, and political prioritization
The Strategic Insight: These cannot be solved simultaneously. But by solving them in the right sequence, you build the power needed to progressively tackle harder ones.
The Flywheel: Start with Paperclip, End with House
Each phase builds specific forms of power that unlock the next:
Phase 1 → Capital, Data, Relationships, Operational Credibility
Phase 2 → Infrastructure Expertise, Utility Trust, Financial Track Record
Phase 3 → Proof of Profitability, Scale, Political Legitimacy
Phase 4 → Systemic Influence, R&D Capabilities, Policy Reform Power
Phase 5 → Global Standard, Ecosystem Creation, Capital Mobilization at Massive Scale
The 5 Phases in Brief
Phase 1: The Wedge - Last-Mile Logistics Platform (Years 0-3)

Pure software play: Three-sided marketplace ("Uber for Water") in Accra
Launch Pod strategy: Constrain market → secure anchor B2B client → onboard supply → expand
Target: $400-600K ARR, 400+ operators, 5M+ transactions, 6-8 cities, 3-4 countries
Ryan works 30-40 hours/week from anywhere while keeping Willow job
Month 30-36: Quits Willow with $150-300K saved, becomes full-time CEO

Phase 2: The Proof - NRW Reduction & Utility Partnerships (Years 3-7)

Solve utilities' most expensive problem: Non-Revenue Water (30-50% losses)
Performance-based contracts: "You pay us 30-40% of revenue we recover over 24-36 months"
Digital twin infrastructure, AI anomaly detection, crew optimization
Target: $8-12M annually, 40-60 employees, $30-50M raised (Series A/B)
Build deep trust with utilities, regulators, development banks

Phase 3: Direct Impact - Infrastructure Operations (Years 5-10)

Transition from service provider to direct operator
Build, own, operate last-mile infrastructure in informal settlements
Partnership model with utilities OR independent licenses
Portfolio: Simplified piped networks, smart standpipes, hybrid delivery
Target: 950K households (4.75M people), $200-350M revenue, $70-120M profit, $1.5-3B valuation
Raise $400-600M from operating cash flow, infrastructure fund, debt financing

Phase 4: The Accelerator - R&D and Policy Reform (Years 10-15)

Dual track: AquaLabs (R&D for tech barriers) + Policy reform (institutional barriers)
Use operational proof to advocate systemic reforms in 10+ countries
Launch AquaAcademy to train new generation of water managers
Certified Operator Program to scale beyond direct operations
Target: 10M people directly, 25-40M via platform, $600M-1B revenue, $200-350M profit, $4-8B valuation
Policy impact: 20+ countries reformed, $20-30B private capital mobilized

Phase 5: The Global Standard - Universal Access Platform (Years 15-20)

Open-source core platform, proprietary advanced features
Create multi-tiered ecosystem: Open source users → Licensees → Certified operators → Direct operations
AquaCapital Fund III: $5-10B fund attracting mainstream institutional capital
Global Water Investment Marketplace
Target: 185-220M people influenced, $1.2-2B revenue, $400-700M profit, $8-15B valuation
Total capital mobilized: $50-80B over 20 years

Why This Timeline?
By 2045 (when Ryan is 60), Water OS will have:

Built multi-billion dollar company
Transformed global water sector
Directly or indirectly improved lives of 200M+ people
Created infrastructure—technical, operational, financial, political—that makes universal access inevitable

The Mission is NOT to solve universal access alone in 20 years.
The Mission is to build the company, technology, and frameworks that make universal access inevitable over the next 30-50 years.

10. Network, Relationships & Trust-Building

Local Team Building: Hire Ghanaians who have existing trust networks
Leverage Mission Alignment: Connect to shared goal of serving underserved communities
Be Direct and Transparent: His authentic directness can be an asset once trust begins


11. Key Learnings from Past Experiences
From Charter School Scaling (Education)
The Franchise Failure:
Charter schools that scaled via franchise models saw quality collapse. The successful networks maintained tight operational control.
Application to Water OS:

No franchising in Water OS strategy
Own core operations, maintain quality, scale carefully
Certified Operator Program in Phase 4 has high bar, not open franchise
Only license technology to proven, high-quality operators

From Building Software Platforms
Technology as Leverage:
Traditional water operators need 100 people; Water OS needs 10 because of intelligent automation, predictive analytics, and platform thinking.
Application to Water OS:

Software and AI are the competitive moat
Build technology that makes operational excellence scalable
This is how to achieve profitability where others can't

From The Gathering Place Crisis
Equity is Non-Negotiable:
When forced to choose between protecting vulnerable students and protecting the company he built, Ryan reported violations despite personal cost.
Application to Water OS:

Will face pressure to compromise quality for growth
Will face opportunities to cut corners in informal settlements
Will face political pressure to look the other way on corruption
This principle provides clarity: equity is the non-negotiable constraint

The Cost of Courage:
Ryan learned that doing the right thing can be extraordinarily costly in the short term, but is the only sustainable path in the long term.
From Scaling RePublic CS Curriculum
Rapid Scaling is Possible with Right Model:
Went from 3 schools to 150 schools across 13 states in 2 years.
Key Success Factors:

Built excellent product first (quality foundation)
Made it easy for others to adopt (low friction)
Provided strong training and support
Strategic partnership model (district partnerships, not just individual schools)

Application to Water OS:

Phases 1-3: Build excellent foundation (quality, profitability, replicability)
Phase 4-5: Make easy to adopt, provide strong support
Use partnership models and ecosystem thinking

From Solo-Building Willow
What's Possible with Agentic AI:
Ryan proved one person with sophisticated AI workflows can build and scale systems that previously required teams.
Application to Water OS:

Phase 1 (solo founder, zero capital) is actually viable
Can build entire software platform himself
Can manage operations remotely with right systems
This validates the capital-light Phase 1 strategy


12. Context for AI Systems Providing Support
How to Work Effectively with Ryan
He values:

Direct, analytical communication: Skip the pleasantries, get to substance
First principles thinking: Don't just accept "how it's done," question assumptions
Comprehensive research: Go deep, find the edge cases, anticipate second-order effects
Action-oriented output: Plans should be executable, not theoretical
Honest assessment: Tell him when his plan has holes; he wants to know before he encounters the problem

He does not value:

Vague advice or platitudes
Analysis without action steps
Over-caution or risk-aversion
Repeating information he already knows

Key Questions for Strategic Counsel
When providing advice on Water OS or related ventures, helpful questions include:
Strategic:

What specific form of power does this action/decision build?
How does this unlock the next phase of the flywheel?
What's the simplest path to validate this assumption?
What are we assuming that we should test first?

Operational:

What's the capital-light version of this approach?
How can AI/automation make this 10x more efficient?
What's the repeatable system underlying this one-time task?
Where's the bottleneck in this process?

Risk Assessment:

What's the worst-case scenario and is it survivable?
What early warning signals would indicate this is failing?
What's the minimum viable test to derisk this?
What dependencies are we underestimating?

Personal:

Is Ryan the right person for this task or should it be delegated?
What skill/knowledge gap needs to be filled?
Is he getting too in the weeds on this?
What's being neglected while focused on this?

Understanding His Risk Profile for Water OS
He is comfortable with:

Financial loss (has savings, can rebuild)
Career risk (can always go back to product/tech roles)
Reputational risk in pursuit of mission
Personal sacrifice (relocation, long hours)
Uncertainty and ambiguity

He is not comfortable with:

Compromising equity and mission
Building unsustainable systems
Harming vulnerable populations
Inaction due to fear

This means:
When assessing risks for Water OS, flag ethical risks and sustainability risks very clearly. Financial and operational risks are acceptable if they serve the mission and can be mitigated.
