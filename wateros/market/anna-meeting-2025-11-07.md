# Meeting with Anna - November 7, 2025

**Date:** November 7, 2025
**Topic:** Water delivery market research in Ghana
**Attendees:** Ryan, Anna

---

## Key Discussion Points

### Traffic and Construction Challenges

Anna reported severe traffic issues on the Tema-Accra motorway due to ongoing construction:
- The Tema motorway is being expanded from 2 lanes to 3 lanes each direction
- Travel time from Tema to Accra requires leaving at 4-5am to arrive by 8am
- Heavy industrial traffic from Tema's industrial areas compounds the problem
- Anna is using alternative routes (beach road, Sakumono road) to avoid worst congestion
- Many people now using motorbikes due to traffic

### Key Findings from Field Research

**Depot Owner Interview Insights:**
- Depot owners charge less than truck drivers
- Truck drivers charge more based on hours spent on the road and distance
- Pricing is highly variable and unregulated

**Water Crisis in Sakumono/Tema:**
- **Sakumono Community 13 has had NO tap water for ONE YEAR**
- Residents are entirely dependent on private tanker water
- One community water seller (polytank owner) has become the main supplier for the entire community
- Demand is overwhelming - he receives calls every day, tanker drivers often don't answer his calls

**Supply Chain Breakdown:**
- Ghana Water Company knows they can't supply the whole country
- GWCL previously partnered with depot/hydrant owners to extend coverage
- In July 2025, GWCL instructed depot owners to suspend all hydrant operations
- Fleet owners now travel to Weija, Amasaman, or Kwabenya to find water
- Some drivers are getting water from informal borehole operators
- One driver was reluctant to share his water source, thinking Anna was from Ghana Water investigating him

### Critical Insights

**The Core Problem:**
> "The demand is horrible. The issue is not with the demand. But it's with how they can get the water to supply to the people."

**Supply vs Demand:**
- Original hypothesis: Hard to get drivers on platform
- Reality: **Drivers desperately need water sources** - demand far exceeds supply
- Getting drivers on platform will be easy if we can provide reliable water access
- The bottleneck is depot access, not driver willingness

**Water Quality Concerns:**
- Drivers getting water from boreholes of unknown treatment status
- No verification system for water quality
- "You don't even know whether it's treated or not. Just because people need water."

## Strategic Priorities Discussed

### Priority 1: Map and Partner with Depots

**Immediate Action Items:**
1. **Create a Google My Maps** showing all depot locations
2. Interview depot owners to understand their needs and pain points
3. Map depot types:
   - Official GWCL resellers (like Denis)
   - Independent borehole operators
   - Any other informal sources
4. Understand depot challenges and what they need from us

**Partnership Value Proposition for Depots:**
- Help them manage chaotic demand
- Organize driver queues (max 3 trucks at a time)
- Handle all payments
- Prioritize drivers in our system
- Make their operations more predictable and profitable

### Priority 2: WhatsApp Broadcast Pilot

**Concept:**
- Daily WhatsApp broadcast to drivers (around 7am)
- List which depots have water that day
- Include depot addresses
- One-way broadcast (drivers don't see each other)

**Benefits:**
- Helps drivers find water immediately
- Builds relationship with drivers before app launch
- Generates testimonials for fundraising
- Helps us learn what information drivers need most
- Tests depot willingness to share availability data

**Timeline:**
- Start in approximately 1 month after mapping 20+ depots
- Get depot buy-in first
- Then recruit drivers to broadcast list

### Priority 3: Continued User Research

**Current Status:**
- Sufficient residential interviews for now
- Continue commercial/business interviews as opportunities arise
- Main focus: depot owners and fleet operators

**Key Metrics to Track:**
1. **Average water delivered per day per driver** (in liters)
2. **Price per liter** drivers are charging
3. **Potential deliveries per day** with optimized system

**Example:**
- Current: 5,000L truck makes 1 delivery/day (5,000L total)
- With WaterOS: Same truck could make 2-3 deliveries/day (10,000-15,000L total)
- Optimization through: route planning, queue management, guaranteed depot access

## Financial Model Considerations

### Revenue Drivers

**Key Variables:**
- Volume of water delivered daily
- Number of active drivers using platform
- Price per liter (currently ~4¢/L, could rise to 6¢/L)
- Platform commission rate

**Example Impact:**
- December 2028 projection: $200,000/month
- If price per liter increases from 4¢ to 6¢: jumps to $300,000/month

### Truck Capacity Breakdown (from Denis interview)

| Capacity (Liters) | Gallons | Selling Price (GHS) |
|-------------------|---------|---------------------|
| 4,500 L | 1,000 gal | 200 |
| 9,000 L | 2,000 gal | 250 |
| 11,250 L | 2,500 gal | 250-300 |
| 16,500 L | 3,500 gal | 500 |
| 18,000 L | 4,000 gal | 600 |
| 22,500 L | 5,000 gal | 700+ |

**Focus:** High-volume commercial customers (hotels, laundromats, schools) using 20,000L+ per day

### Market Size Questions

**Known Data:**
- World Bank study (5 years ago): 2,072 water trucks in Accra
- Current estimate: 3,000+ trucks (growth due to water crisis)

**Research Needs:**
- City business registry for water truck operators?
- Water truck repair shops as information source?
- Water truck sellers/manufacturers?

## Ghana Water Company Context

### Non-Revenue Water Crisis

**Critical Statistics:**
- Well-established water utilities: ~5% non-revenue water
- African utilities average: ~20% non-revenue water
- **Ghana Water Company: 50% non-revenue water**

**What This Means:**
> "One out of every two liters that taxpayers pay to treat at the water treatment plant disappears before generating revenue."

**Causes:**
1. Old, leaking pipes
2. Informal, unprofessional connections in informal settlements
3. Illegal tapping
4. Poor infrastructure maintenance

**Investment Barrier:**
- Foreign investors won't invest in Ghana Water until non-revenue water is addressed
- Technology could help (drone surveillance, sensors) but requires capital
- This is THE major barrier to improving municipal water supply

### Long-term Vision

**After WaterOS Success:**
1. Prove we can organize last-mile delivery
2. Build cash reserves and purchasing power
3. Partner with GWCL on non-revenue water solutions
4. Use technology (drones, sensors) to identify leaks
5. Attract foreign investment once we demonstrate capability
6. Expand to help GWCL improve infrastructure

> "If we have half a million dollars that we're able to use to start investing in getting the water infrastructure fixed, Ghana Water will be very interested."

## Anna's Key Questions

### Pricing Strategy
- How do we create a pricing system that:
  - Benefits customers (better than current informal prices)
  - Is fair to drivers
  - Is profitable for WaterOS
  - Accounts for variable traffic/distance costs

### Value Proposition
- Need clear advantages for platform users:
  - Better prices
  - Faster service
  - More reliable
  - Verified water quality

### GWCL Partnership
- Long-term opportunity to partner with Ghana Water
- Help bring in foreign investment
- Overcome African mindset that favors foreign solutions
- Address Ghana Water's systemic challenges

## Notable Quotes

**On the core problem:**
> "The demand is horrible. And the issue is not with the demand. But it's with how they can get the water to supply to the people. That's the issue now that we need to look at critically."

**On water quality:**
> "You are getting it from a borehole. You don't even know whether it's treated or not. Just because people need water."

**On depot owner stress:**
> "Imagine a hospital with no water. I get calls all night; I can't even sleep." - Denis (Depot Owner)

**On transportation costs:**
> "If you are doing like 45 minutes [in Uber], you are paying as much as almost 120 Ghana cedis. That's like $12. Meanwhile, if I'm to take public transport, I shouldn't pay more than $3."

**On timeline:**
> "My hope is to actually launch the business and start running transactions through the system in September of 2026."
