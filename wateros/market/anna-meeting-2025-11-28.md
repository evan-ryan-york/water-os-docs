### Part 2: Why GWCL Shut Down Private Depots

**Key Revelation from GWCL Engineer:**

The engineer explained the real reason depots were shut down - **theft**, not just operational issues.

**How the Theft Works:**
- GWCL sells water to private depots at very low rates (~15 cedis per cubic meter, approximately $1.50)
- Depot owners then sell at higher prices (which GWCL has no problem with)
- However, depot owners were installing **illegal bypass connections** to tap water before the meter
- This means the meter doesn't read the actual amount of water being used
- When caught, depots are fined up to 70,000 cedis (~$7,000)
- Many pay the fine because they were making more money from theft

**The Engineer's Frustration:**
> "Ghana Water is selling it to you at cost. Why then do you still get another connection to steal more water?"

**Current GWCL Strategy:**
- Shut down most private depots
- Opened only 4 public hydrants in Accra that GWCL directly controls:
  1. **37 (GWCL compound)** - meter reads directly, payment goes to GWCL
  2. **Awoshie**
  3. **Tema Free Zone** (recently reopened after being locked)
  4. **East Legon** (Anna to visit next week)

**Scale Problem:**
- 4 hydrants serving ~2,000+ trucks (likely closer to 3,000 now)
- Each truck takes ~30 minutes to fill
- ~10 usable hours per day = 20 trucks per hydrant per day
- 4 hydrants × 20 trucks = **80 trucks/day capacity**
- That's only **~4% of the truck fleet**

> "They're servicing 80 trucks a day out of over 2,000... that's so inefficient."

### Part 3: Private Depot Water Storage Model

**Key Discovery - Reservoir Model:**
Many private depots don't have hydrants. Instead they use:
- Large underground reservoirs built under houses
- Multiple polytanks (one person has 50 polytanks)
- They fill when GWCL turns on water for their area, then sell to truckers

**The Polytank Problem:**
- When GWCL opens taps for a community, large depot owners fill all their storage first
- By the time water reaches residential users, it's gone
- GWCL allocates a fixed volume per community - they don't care who gets it

> "Ghana Water doesn't really care about who gets water or who doesn't. Their issue is that they're releasing water and people are still stealing it."

### Part 4: Borehole Water Demand

**Surprising Finding:**
Some customers specifically request borehole water over treated pipe water because it's cheaper.

**Borehole Limitations:**
- Water is often salty
- Used mainly for non-drinking purposes:
  - Flushing toilets
  - Public washrooms
  - Commercial washing (fish, chicken)
  - Cleaning
- Cannot scale to serve population - would only cover ~0.1% of demand

> "Under optimal conditions, if Accra were able to get as much water as possible from boreholes, it would serve 0.1% of the population."

### Part 5: Meter Pilot Strategy

**The Core Business Model:**

1. Install digital meters on private depot pipes
2. Track water coming in (from GWCL) vs. water sold (to truckers)
3. If incoming ≠ sold, there's theft/loss
4. Provide this data to GWCL to prove the depot isn't stealing
5. In return, GWCL keeps water on for that depot
6. WaterOS takes a transaction fee on sales

**Simplified First Step:**
- Don't worry about digital payments yet
- Just get a meter installed on a private depot's pipe
- Provide them with free usage data
- Frame it as: "This helps you know exactly how much water you're using and prevents truckers from underpaying"

**Value Proposition to Depot Owners:**
- Free data on daily water usage
- Compare to their books to ensure truckers pay correctly
- Protection against employees making side deals
- No mention of GWCL monitoring initially (may scare them)

**Technical Challenges:**
- Traditional meters require cutting into pipes (not ideal)
- Looking at ultrasonic/acoustic meters that clamp onto pipes
- Problem: Photos show old, rusted pipes - may not work with acoustic meters
- Alternative: Custom fitting that attaches to end of hydrant hose

**Action Item for Anna:**
Get photos of a truck being filled - specifically how the hose connects to the hydrant and truck.

### Part 6: Map Update & Geographic Coverage

**Current Mapped Locations:**

| Location | Type | Status | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| GWCL 37 | Public | ✅ Open | On GWCL compound, meter reads directly |
| GWCL Tema Free Zone | Public | ✅ Open | Recently reopened |
| Waterworks (Lapaz) | Private | Mapped | Just added this week |
| Timber Market | Private | Mapped | Changed from yellow |
| Community One Market | Private | ❌ Shutdown | No hydrant, uses reservoir storage |
| East Legon | Public | 🔍 To visit | Anna going next week |

**Anna's Location:**
- Lives near Tema 22 Police Station
- About 15-20 minutes from the Tema depot cluster
- Tema/Sakumono area has more depots because water issues are most severe there

**Key Insight on Tema Area:**
> "Water flows twice every week and people don't have storage. After using everything, they rely on depots. That's why this part has more depots and truck drivers."

### Part 7: WhatsApp Broadcast Progress

**Depots Willing to Share Water Status:**

| Name | Location | Type | Willing? | Method |
|------|----------|------|----------|--------|
| Mr. James | Waterworks | Private | ✅ Yes | WhatsApp |
| Ebo | Awoshie | Private | ✅ Yes | Phone call |
| Bra Emmanuel | Water Supply | Private | ✅ Yes | Phone call |
| Community One | Market | Private | ❓ To ask | - |
| Shy Hills | Far location | Private | ❌ Not contacted | 4 hours away |

**Truck Driver Outreach:**
- Spoke to Truck Drivers Association head at Malam/Lapaz
- He has ~40 truck drivers under him
- Willing to share all their contact numbers
- Can help schedule group meetings

### Part 8: Relationship with GWCL Engineer

**Concern Raised by Anna:**
> "I don't want them to steal our idea. You know my Ghanaian people."

**Ryan's Response:**
> "Executing an idea is so much harder than having the idea. You move faster by sharing openly and finding people who want to work with you."

**Reasoning:**
- GWCL's problems are lack of money and people, not lack of ideas
- WaterOS can bring people and some money
- Being open builds trust and partnerships
- Proprietary concerns can come later for specific business elements

**Engineer's Interest:**
- Head of Technology and Innovation at GWCL head office
- Very enthused about meeting Ryan
- Scheduled for February visit
- Open to video call before then

2. 🎯 Go back to Ebo and pitch the meter pilot
3. 🎯 Frame as: "Free data on your water usage to prevent underpayment"
4. 📸 Get photos of truck being filled (hose connection to hydrant and truck)

**Mapping - Priority 2:**
5. 🎯 Add remaining 2 public depots to the map (East Legon, one other)
6. 🎯 Put "GWCL" prefix on all public depot names
7. 🎯 Continue mapping all private depots found

**Depot Outreach:**
8. 🔄 Visit East Legon hydrant next week
9. 🔄 Check on Community One Market status
10. 🔄 Continue relationship building with private depot owners

**Data Collection:**
11. 📊 Create Excel sheet with depot owner WhatsApp numbers
12. 📊 Start tracking which depots have water each day (even without broadcast)
13. 📊 Add status ratings to all contacts (excited/interested/neutral/reluctant/not interested)

### For Ryan

1. Research meter options that don't require pipe cutting
2. Design custom hose fitting for water measurement
3. Build spreadsheet for daily water availability tracking
4. Prepare for potential video call with GWCL engineer

## Key Insights

**On Why Private Depots Were Shut Down:**
> "The main reason they shut down those depots was because majority of them are thieves. They steal the water. Although they are selling it at a very low price, they still find ways to fill more water than the meter reads."

**On GWCL's True Priority:**
> "Ghana Water doesn't really care about who gets water or who doesn't. Their issue is that they're releasing water and people are still stealing it."

**On the Scale Problem:**
> "4 hydrants serving 80 trucks a day out of over 2,000... they're still going to have to work with the private depots."

**On Sharing Ideas Openly:**
> "Executing an idea is so much harder than having the idea. GWCL's problems have to do with a lack of money and people, not a lack of ideas."

**On Depot Owner Willingness:**
> "If I was running a depot, I would have just agreed to this."

## Strategic Takeaways

1. **Theft is the Core Problem:** GWCL shut down depots because of bypass connections stealing water, not operational issues. Our meter solution directly addresses this.

2. **4 Public Hydrants Can't Scale:** With only 80 trucks/day capacity vs 2,000+ trucks, GWCL must work with private depots. Our solution enables that.

3. **Simplify the Pitch:** Don't mention GWCL monitoring to depot owners initially. Frame as free data for their own benefit.

4. **Reservoir Depots are Different:** Many private depots don't have hydrants - they store water in polytanks/reservoirs. May need different metering approach.

5. **Start Simple:** Get a meter installed first, worry about digital payments later. Prove the concept before adding complexity.
