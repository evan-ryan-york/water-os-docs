## Key Discussion Points

### Part 1: Public vs. Private Depot Structure

**Key Findings from GWCL Contact:**

Anna spoke with someone in GWCL's research department who explained the depot structure:

**Two Types of Depots:**
1. **Public Depots** - Managed by Ghana Water, regulated pricing with thresholds
2. **Private Depots** - Individual owners, were overpricing (70%+ above public rates)

**Why Private Depots Were Shut Down:**
- Private depot owners were overpricing significantly
- GWCL's reasoning: "If private owners are charging so much, Ghana Water can do it themselves and put meters in place"
- The shutdown is temporary - depots expected to reopen in ~2 weeks

**GWCL's Suggestion:**
> "If you want 10 depots that would always have water, you should consider connecting with the Ghana Water depot owners instead of the private ones - they have water and are still running."

### Part 2: The Scale Problem

**Ryan's Analysis:**
- If public depots still have water, and truck drivers still can't find water, there aren't enough public depots
- Ghana Water knows they can't supply the entire population alone
- Even if they could magically eliminate all private depots, they couldn't meet demand
- Private depot network is essential - they just need to operate in a way where GWCL gets their revenue share

**Strategic Insight:**
> "Ghana Water's utility is too broke to actually provide enough water for everyone. Population growth plus infrastructure decay means they're going in the wrong direction. Private network actually needs to be operating."

### Part 3: Mapping Challenges

**Field Research Difficulties:**
- Severe traffic in Accra
- People thought Anna was a journalist or Ghana Water investigator
- Some refused to share depot locations fearing she would "lock them up"
- Some depots were closed with dusty trucks parked (idle for months)
- Some depot owners also own the trucks

**Dangerous Encounter - Illegal Water Source:**
- Found truckers fetching water from under a bridge near Valco Road/Refinery area
- When Anna approached, they nearly attacked her
- They feared she was going to report them to Ghana Water
- Water source appeared to be untreated and illegal

> "It's more of an illegal something they are doing. They can't let you know."

### Part 4: Ghana Water Internal Dynamics

**Interesting Discovery:**
Some private depots may be owned by Ghana Water employees:

> "It could be that individuals in Ghana Water have opened depots. Because they work in Ghana Water, they would always have the water running for their depots."

**GWCL Contact Details:**
- Works at head office in research department
- Reads about developments in water sector globally and advises Ghana Water
- Has friends in IT Department (web developers, front-end/back-end)
- GWCL launched a water bill payment app two years ago
- Offered to connect Anna with his manager for collaboration discussions

### Part 5: Value Proposition Development

**What WaterOS Offers Ghana Water:**
- Real-time data on water flowing in and out of every depot
- Visibility into transactions, pricing, and delivery patterns
- Help identify and reduce theft/non-revenue water
- Technology infrastructure they don't have resources to build themselves

**Ryan's Pitch Framework:**
> "We can put sensors on every meter going in and out and give them real-time data of every ounce of water. This will not only save them money - they will make money from that. They will be able to bring private depots into partnership and reap the benefits."

**What WaterOS Offers Depot Owners:**
- Visibility and social media presence (most have none)
- Business branding help (some don't even have business names)
- Access to more truck drivers/customers
- Legitimacy and structure

**Current Depot Owner Profile:**
- Many are older (50+), not educated
- Anna had to speak local dialect with some
- No social media presence - rely on word of mouth
- "Rich, uneducated people who want to invest in something"
- Example: "My name is Ebo. If you come around asking for Ebo, everybody knows who Ebo is"

### Part 6: Concerns About GWCL Interference

**Anna's Concerns:**

1. **Corruption Risk:**
> "Some of those at the top are even in charge of some of the private depots that are overpricing. I wouldn't be shocked if some of them are involved."

2. **Price Regulation:**
- GWCL wants to set minimum thresholds for water pricing
- This doesn't account for distance/fuel costs
- Trucker picking water from Kasoa to deliver in Tema needs to factor transportation
- Fixed pricing across Accra isn't feasible

3. **"What's in it for Ghana Water?"**
- GWCL contact already asked this question
- Need clear answer before meeting with manager

**Ryan's Response:**

The trade-off for GWCL:
- They get complete visibility: where water goes, what drivers charge, how much is sold
- Every transaction goes through the system - they get their share
- They don't have to chase down illegal operations
- In return, they must ensure depots using the app always have water

> "Ghana Water is going to make more money. But they have to partner with us to make that happen."

### Part 7: Borehole Water Sources

**Alternative Water Sources:**
- Some truckers getting water from boreholes
- Borehole operators were reluctant to share information
- Anna trying to set up conversations with 2 borehole operators
- Need to understand: Do they treat the water? What methods?

**Long-term Consideration:**
Anna suggested WaterOS could eventually have its own water plant/treatment facility as a revenue source and to reduce GWCL dependency.

### Part 8: Branding Discussion

**Target Audiences:**
- Water purchasers (residential/commercial)
- Truck drivers
- Depot owners
- Ghana Water
- Investors (local and international)
- NGOs working on water issues

**Radio Advertising:**
- Radio is main media for truck drivers while driving
- Top stations: **Peace FM** (local language, most popular), **Joy FM**
- Radio still popular but "fading out"

**Depot Owner Demographics:**
- Older (50+), not very educated
- Not app-savvy or social media users
- Primarily use phone calls
- Facebook is most likely social platform if any

**Logo Feedback:**
- Water droplet imagery important for uneducated users
- Logo should communicate "water" without needing to read
- Example given: Ghana Electricity app shows electricity symbol - even uneducated users understand it
- Preference for clear visual symbols over abstract letters

**Website:**
- Domain secured: **clearwaterafrica.com**
- Website nearly complete

### Part 9: Willingness to Meet Ryan

**GWCL Interest:**
- Manager may want to speak with Ryan directly
- Anna can set up video calls
- Ryan considering visiting Ghana in early January (in addition to planned February trip)
- If video call isn't enough, in-person meeting can wait for visit

## Key Insights

**On Private Depot Necessity:**
> "It's an essential part of the system. The private network actually needs to be operating - just in a way where GWCL gets their part of that revenue."

**On Illegal Water Sources:**
> "They nearly attacked me. They thought I was coming to video them and take them to Ghana Water to report them."

**On Depot Owner Education Level:**
> "Most of the depot owners, especially the private ones, are not really educated. Some of them, I had to speak the local dialect with them."

**On Building Trust:**
> "When I have the conversation on the phone with them, they don't even want to speak to me. But when I go there in person, they don't want to stop talking to me."

**On GWCL Corruption Concerns:**
> "In Ghana, power is very sweet. Those who have power are a bit intimidating. I'm hoping the bureaucracy doesn't end us."

**On Price Regulation:**
> "You can't regulate the price for everybody in Accra because distance is a factor. Fuel consumption is a factor."

## Strategic Takeaways

1. **Public Depots Insufficient:** Even with water, public depots can't meet demand. Private network is essential.

2. **GWCL Needs Us:** They don't have the technology, money, or people to solve their problems alone. We bring all three.

3. **The Deal:** GWCL gets complete transaction visibility and guaranteed revenue. In return, they keep water flowing to partner depots.

4. **Trust Building is Key:** In-person relationships matter more than phone/digital. Anna's physical presence opens doors.

5. **Expect Corruption:** Some GWCL insiders likely own private depots. Navigate carefully.

6. **Radio for Drivers:** Peace FM and Joy FM are the channels to reach truck drivers.
