## Key Discussion Points

### Part 1: Public vs. Private Depot Classification

**Depot Classification Findings:**
- Some depots operate with "permission" from Ghana Water but aren't strictly public or private
- Truck drivers sometimes fetch water from private houses during shortages—homeowners who still have water sell to truckers

**Key Distinction Identified:**
- **Public Depots:** Staff are paid by Ghana Water. Revenue goes to Ghana Water. Truckers go to a separate office to check meters and pay directly to GWCL.
- **Private Depots:** Individual owns the license to operate. Pays water bill to Ghana Water per meter reading. Keeps revenue directly and pays own staff.

**Example - Awoshie Depot:**
- Private depot owned by an individual
- Licensed to operate
- Pays GWCL for water like a normal customer (per meter reading)
- Retains revenue and pays staff directly

### Part 2: Geographic Water Availability Map

**Current Water Status by Area:**

| Area | Water Status | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Tema/Sakumono | ❌ No water | Very few working depots |
| Industrial Area | ✅ Limited | One hydrant recently opened |
| Spintex/Teshie/Labadi | ❌ No water | No working depots |
| Accra Central (37/Park) | ✅ Has water | Depots operational |
| East Legon | ✅ Has water | Wealthy area, water available |
| Haatso/Madina | ✅ Recently opened | Depots were closed, just reopened in last 2 weeks |
| Achimota | 🔍 To be researched | Anna visiting next |

**Why Truckers Can't Find Water Despite Depots Existing:**
1. **Distance:** Traveling from Tema to Accra is very far with severe traffic
2. **Cost:** Long travel increases selling price, making water unaffordable
3. **Closures:** Many depots were shut down until recently
4. **Thursday closures:** Depots close every Thursday

**Geographic Research Approach:**
Anna is dividing Accra into four sections for research:
1. Tema area (completed)
2. 37/Accra Central (in progress)
3. Spintex/Nungua area
4. Adenta/Ashale Botwe/Madina area (next week)

**Key Insight:**
> Water issues are more prevalent in Tema area compared to central areas—fewer working depots in Tema.

### Part 3: WhatsApp Broadcast Strategy

**Original Test Concept:**
Get drivers to sign up for a WhatsApp broadcast sharing which depots have water each day.

**The Ask to Depots:**
Each morning, depots send a message on WhatsApp sharing whether or not they have water. WaterOS aggregates and broadcasts to truckers.

**Benefits:**
- Depots get more business/customers
- Truckers know where to find water

**Challenges Identified:**
- Anna needs to return to previously visited depots to get WhatsApp numbers
- Need to explain the value proposition before asking for availability updates

**Critical Insight - Age Demographics:**
> "Most of the depot managers, especially the private ones, are between the ages of 45 and above. In Ghana, people in that age bracket aren't really 'WhatsApp people.' They use phones for calls and Mobile Money."

**Solution:**
- We may need to call depot owners each morning rather than relying on WhatsApp messages
- Truck drivers are different—they speak good English and use WhatsApp readily

**This Week's Goal:**
Get contact information for the owner of every depot (public or private, whether they have water now or not).

### Part 4: Ghana Water Company (GWCL) Strategy

**GWCL Contact Update:**
Anna spoke with an engineer who raised key questions:
1. What is the volume of water depots will consume daily? (GWCL has thresholds they cannot exceed)
2. What is in it for Ghana Water?
3. Formal letter process takes ~2 months

**Ryan's Position:**
- Too early to submit a formal proposal (3-5 months away)
- Current focus should be relationship building, not agreements
- Goal: Learn GWCL's pain points (Non-Revenue Water, turbidity shutting down plants)

**Proposed Experiment - Digital Metering:**
- Pay to install a digital meter on a private depot's pipe
- Provide GWCL with minute-by-minute data from that meter
- Track payments from depot to water company
- Help GWCL verify they're getting paid for water pumped

**Value Proposition to GWCL:**
> GWCL is currently losing roughly 45 million gallons per day to Non-Revenue Water. Real-time metered data from private depots helps verify payment and reduce losses.

**Anna's Response:**
> "That would be very helpful to them."

**Current GWCL Goal:**
Relationship building. Ask: "If we could provide you with real-time metered data for a private depot to verify you are getting paid, would that be useful?"

### Part 5: Trip Logistics (February 2025)

**Ryan's Trip Dates:**
February 12-23, 2025

**Accommodation Recommendations:**
- ✅ Airport Residential or Accra Mall area (central, easier movement)
- ✅ Spintex Road area (acceptable)
- ❌ Teshie (horrible roads - avoid)
- ❌ Densu Delta area (2 hours from Tema - too far)

**Anna's Insight:**
> "Airport is the center, so you can move between Tema and Spintex easily."

**Proximity Bonus:**
Airport Residential is on the route to GWCL head office (near National Theatre/Sports Stadium).

### Part 6: Admin & Legal Updates

**Payment Discussion:**
- Current: ~2,270 Cedis/week through Upwork (they take a cut)
- Alternative: Remitly direct payment (more money to Anna)
- Decision left to Anna regarding tax/reporting preferences

**Legal Progress:**
- Ryan met with lawyers: Sey & York, located in East Legon
- Beginning legal paperwork to set up business as foreign investor
- Expected timeline: Legal entity in 5-6 months

**Anna's Connection:**
Has a classmate who is a lawyer—offered to connect Ryan if needed.

## Action Items

### For Anna (This Week)

**Primary Focus - Depots:**
1. 🎯 Find, map, and interview depot owners (private and public)
2. 🎯 Get contact info/WhatsApp numbers for all depot owners
3. 🎯 Ask depots: "Are you willing to share daily water status so we can broadcast to truckers?"
4. 🎯 Return to previously visited depots to get contact information

**GWCL:**
5. 🔄 Continue building relationship with GWCL engineer
6. 🎯 Ask: "Would real-time data from private depots to verify payment be useful?"

**Research Pause:**
- Halt commercial/residential research temporarily
- Focus purely on depots and truckers

### For Ryan

1. Finalize February trip accommodations (Airport/Spintex area)
2. Continue legal entity setup with Sey & York
3. Prepare digital meter experiment details for GWCL pitch

## Key Insights

**On Finding Water Sources:**
> "I saw them fetching water from someone's house. Apparently, when there is a shortage, some private houses still have water. So, the truck drivers go to those houses to fetch water from them and sell it."

**On Distance as the Main Barrier:**
> "If you consider moving all the way from Tema to Accra, it is very long. You spend so much time in traffic. People wouldn't want to travel that far because the cost of selling the water would go high."

**On Depot Reopening:**
> "The water was closed until just two weeks ago when they opened it for the public."

**On Depot Owner Demographics:**
> "Most of the depot managers, especially the private ones, are between the ages of 45 and above. In Ghana, people in that age bracket aren't really 'WhatsApp people.'"

## Strategic Takeaways

1. **Geographic Strategy Validated:** Water availability varies dramatically by neighborhood. Mapping is critical.

2. **WhatsApp Pilot Feasible:** Depots likely willing to share status, but may require phone calls rather than WhatsApp messages due to age demographics.

3. **GWCL Value Prop Crystallized:** Real-time metering data to verify payments directly addresses their Non-Revenue Water problem.

4. **Timeline Clarity:** Legal entity in 5-6 months, Ryan's visit in February aligns with depot relationship building phase.
