  "title": "The Economics of Desalination: How Advanced Technologies Are Making Seawater Conversion Cost-Effective",
  "summary": "As global water scarcity affects over 2.1 billion people, desalination technologies have become increasingly viable solutions for freshwater supply. Reverse osmosis costs have dropped dramatically from over $10 per cubic meter decades ago to as low as $0.50 per cubic meter today, with projections suggesting costs could reach $0.30 by 2030. Innovations in membrane technology, energy recovery systems, and renewable energy integration are driving these cost reductions while expanding global desalination capacity.",
  "bulletPoints": [
    "Seawater reverse osmosis (RO) dominates the industry with costs ranging from $0.50-$2.50 per cubic meter ($1.90-$9.50 per 1,000 gallons), representing a 33% cost reduction between 2015-2022 alone",
    "Energy consumption accounts for 44% of total desalination costs, making efficiency improvements through advanced membranes, energy recovery devices achieving 96%+ efficiency, and renewable energy integration the primary cost-reduction strategies",
    "Emerging technologies including forward osmosis, membrane distillation, and capacitive deionization operate at one-fifth the energy requirements of conventional RO, potentially reducing costs to $0.20 per cubic meter",
    "Modern RO facilities integrate sophisticated systems including graphene-reinforced membranes with 2-3x greater permeability, AI-assisted monitoring, and solar/wind power to minimize operational expenses",
    "Brackish water desalination offers lower costs ($0.30-$1.00 per cubic meter) than seawater treatment due to reduced salinity requiring less pressure and energy input"
