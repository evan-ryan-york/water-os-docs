  "title": "Solar Still Technology: Methods and Advancements for Water Purification Using Solar Energy",
  "summary": "A solar still is a simple device that uses solar heat to purify brackish or saline water through evaporation and condensation. Multiple research studies demonstrate various enhancement techniques including fins, energy storage materials, reflectors, and multi-basin designs that can improve distillate output from typical yields of 3-5 L/m²/day to over 12 L/m²/day. Despite technological improvements showing efficiency gains up to 60-70%, solar stills remain underutilized commercially due to relatively low productivity and large land requirements.",
  "bulletPoints": [
    "Solar stills work by heating saline water in a black-lined basin, causing evaporation that condenses on a transparent cover and collects as purified water, with typical productivity ranging from 4-6 L/m²/day",
    "Enhancement methods significantly improve performance: fins increase surface area and heat distribution, energy storage materials (like black gravels, charcoal, or wax) extend production into off-sunshine hours, and multi-basin designs recover latent heat of condensation",
    "Advanced designs show substantial improvements - pyramid solar stills can achieve over 66% efficiency, evacuated tube integration can produce 8.1 L/m²/day, and cascade systems with flat plate collectors reach 13.63 L/m²/day",
    "Economic analysis reveals cost per liter ranges from $0.0013 to $0.033 depending on design, with low-concentrating photovoltaic-thermal solar stills being most economical and optimal designs balancing productivity with cost",
    "Key performance factors include solar intensity, wind velocity, water depth (lower depths increase productivity), glass cover angle, basin area, and use of materials like nanofluids, phase change materials, and reflectors to maximize heat absorption and retention"
