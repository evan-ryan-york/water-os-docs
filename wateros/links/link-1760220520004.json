  "title": "Energy Efficiency Comparison: Capacitive Deionization vs. Reverse Osmosis for Brackish Water Desalination",
  "summary": "This study systematically compares the energy consumption of capacitive deionization (CDI) and reverse osmosis (RO) for brackish water desalination using system-scale models. The research demonstrates that RO is significantly more energy efficient than CDI, particularly for higher salinity feeds and higher salt rejection requirements. For brackish water at 2000 mg/L with 50% recovery and 75% salt rejection, CDI requires over eight times more energy than RO (0.85 vs 0.09 kWh/m³).",
  "bulletPoints": [
    "RO is significantly more energy efficient than CDI for brackish water desalination, consuming up to 8 times less energy under comparable operating conditions",
    "For 2000 mg/L brackish water with 50% water recovery and 75% salt rejection at 10 L/m²/h flux, CDI requires 0.85 kWh/m³ compared to only 0.09 kWh/m³ for RO",
    "Future improvements in CDI electrode materials (capacitance, charge efficiency, conductivity) can only marginally reduce energy consumption and cannot close the efficiency gap with RO",
    "CDI cannot compete with RO on the basis of both energy consumption and capital cost for brackish water desalination applications",
    "The study reveals that many previous claims of CDI being more energy efficient than RO were based on unfair comparisons between bench-scale CDI and large-scale RO systems with different performance parameters"
