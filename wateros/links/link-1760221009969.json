  "title": "Artificial Intelligence Applications in Renewable Energy-Driven Desalination Systems: A Critical Review",
  "summary": "This critical review examines how artificial intelligence technologies are being applied to optimize renewable energy-driven seawater desalination systems. The study analyzes AI applications across four key processes: site selection, energy prediction, technology selection, and parameter optimization. The research identifies artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms as the most widely adopted AI approaches for handling complex, multi-objective nonlinear problems in desalination system design.",
  "bulletPoints": [
    "AI is applied in desalination systems across four main areas: expert decision-making, optimization, prediction, and control throughout the design process",
    "Artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms are the most mature and widespread AI technologies for solving multi-objective nonlinear problems in desalination",
    "AI implementation in desalination systems maximizes efficiency, minimizes costs, and reduces human resource requirements compared to traditional experience-based approaches",
    "The four critical processes in desalination system design are site selection, energy prediction, desalination technology selection, and systematic parameter optimization",
    "AI technologies effectively address complex problems that cannot be solved through simple mathematical models or expert experience alone"
