  "title": "Digital Twins and AI Transform Seawater Desalination Plants for Greater Efficiency and Security",
  "summary": "Tedagua's Digital Twin Platform for Desalination Plants (2022-2024) integrates AI, IoT, and cloud computing to address the critical challenges of high energy costs and cybersecurity vulnerabilities in reverse osmosis desalination facilities. The project, co-financed by NextGenerationEU funds, demonstrates how advanced digital technologies can optimize operations, reduce energy consumption, and strengthen security in critical water infrastructure. Real-world implementation across multiple Tedagua plants has delivered measurable improvements in efficiency, cybersecurity, and data-driven decision-making.",
  "bulletPoints": [
    "The platform reduced energy consumption through AI-optimized operating pressure, demand forecasting, and predictive maintenance, directly lowering operating costs that typically represent up to 70% of expenses",
    "A comprehensive digital twin architecture combines high-fidelity 3D modeling, real-time IoT sensor data, machine learning models, and deep neural networks to enable predictive analysis and operational optimization",
    "Cybersecurity was significantly strengthened through continuous behavioral monitoring, network segmentation, and automated threat response protocols that can neutralize intrusions without operator intervention",
    "The modular, scalable architecture allows adaptation to desalination plants of varying sizes and complexities, enabling replication across different operational contexts worldwide",
    "Five interconnected work packages addressed data acquisition, digital twin development, resilient data architecture, pattern detection, and process optimization to create a comprehensive intelligent management system"
