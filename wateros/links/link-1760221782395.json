  "title": "Why Desalination Is Not a Viable Solution for Sub-Saharan Africa's Water Crisis",
  "summary": "The Water Project explains why desalination technology, despite converting saltwater to freshwater globally, is not practical for addressing water scarcity in sub-Saharan Africa. While over 22,000 desalination plants exist worldwide, they are expensive, energy-intensive, environmentally problematic, and require complex infrastructure that is difficult to maintain in the regions where The Water Project operates. The organization focuses instead on smaller, sustainable, community-based water projects that are easier to monitor, maintain, and can be managed by local governments and communities.",
  "bulletPoints": [
    "Desalination is extremely costly and energy-intensive, with plants responsible for 76 million tons of CO2 emissions annually, expected to reach 400 million tons by 2050",
    "The technology poses environmental challenges including harm to marine life, membrane waste disposal, and concentrated brine byproduct that requires disposal",
    "Implementation in sub-Saharan Africa faces major obstacles including funding challenges, lack of existing water distribution infrastructure, supply chain concerns for replacement parts, and the need for specialized staff training",
    "Desalination projects in Africa remain stuck in development—a planned Mombasa, Kenya plant has been in financial planning since 2018 with concerns about long-term operational sustainability",
    "The Water Project's approach of smaller, community-based water projects is more practical, sustainable, and faster to implement, with local capacity-building ensuring communities can maintain systems themselves"
