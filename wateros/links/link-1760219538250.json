  "title": "MIT Engineers Develop Solar-Powered Desalination System That Produces Freshwater Cheaper Than Tap Water",
  "summary": "MIT researchers have created a passive, solar-powered desalination device that converts seawater into drinking water more affordably than tap water. The system mimics ocean thermohaline circulation to prevent salt buildup while producing 4-6 liters of drinkable water per hour when scaled to suitcase size. This breakthrough could provide sustainable freshwater solutions for off-grid coastal communities.",
  "bulletPoints": [
    "The device uses solar heat and natural circulation patterns similar to ocean currents to evaporate seawater while preventing salt crystallization and clogging",
    "A suitcase-sized system could produce 4-6 liters of drinking water per hour and last several years before needing replacement parts",
    "The system achieves both high water-production rates and high salt-rejection rates, outperforming all other passive solar desalination concepts currently being tested",
    "Production costs are estimated to be lower than U.S. tap water, making it the first solar desalination technology to achieve this price point",
    "The entirely passive system requires no electricity to operate and is designed for scalability to meet household water needs in coastal areas"
