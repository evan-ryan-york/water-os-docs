  "title": "A Comprehensive Review of Solar Still Technologies and Cost: Innovations in Materials, Design, and Techniques for Enhanced Water Desalination Efficiency",
  "summary": "This comprehensive review examines recent advancements in solar still (SS) desalination technologies aimed at addressing global freshwater scarcity, particularly in arid regions. The study analyzes innovative materials including phase change materials (PCMs) and thermoelectric modules (TEMs), thermal management strategies, and hybrid system designs that have demonstrated productivity improvements ranging from 140% to over 6-fold in optimized configurations. The review synthesizes performance metrics, cost-effectiveness data (as low as 0.011 USD/L in certain configurations), and future integration opportunities for advancing sustainable solar desalination.",
  "bulletPoints": [
    "Phase change materials (PCMs) and thermoelectric modules (TEMs) show significant productivity gains, with improvements up to 140% and 6.7-fold respectively in select solar still configurations",
    "Hybrid systems combining multiple technologies achieve the highest performance: double-glazed glass with fins and TEMs (5.7-fold increase), and CuO-water nanofluids with TEMs and vibration (5.3-fold increase)",
    "Cost analysis reveals competitive water production rates, with integrated systems achieving as low as 0.011 USD/L in real-world conditions (Rajshahi, Bangladesh) using external condensers and solar collectors",
    "Key enhancement strategies include external heat sources (solar collectors, ponds), thermal energy storage, reflective surfaces, external condensers, cover cooling techniques, and extended evaporation surface areas",
    "Future research directions emphasize integration of PCM, TEM, nanotechnology, and advanced geometric designs to overcome current limitations and scale up solar desalination systems for broader applicability"
