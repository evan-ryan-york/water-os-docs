  "title": "Utilizing Artificial Intelligence to Predict Membrane Behaviour in Water Purification and Desalination",
  "summary": "This review explores how artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, including machine learning and artificial neural networks, can predict and optimize membrane performance in water treatment processes. AI models demonstrate superior predictive capabilities compared to traditional methods for forecasting membrane fouling, water flux, and micropollutant behavior. The study emphasizes AI's potential to enhance wastewater treatment efficiency and address global water scarcity challenges through improved desalination and purification processes.",
  "bulletPoints": [
    "AI models (CNNs, RNNs, SVMs) outperform traditional methods in predicting membrane fouling, water flux, and treatment efficiency with R² values reaching 0.99 or higher",
    "Membrane separation methods (RO, FO, NF, UF, MF) are more environmentally friendly and energy-efficient than conventional desalination techniques like MED and MED-TVC",
    "Deep learning techniques like LSTM models can accurately predict fouling layer thickness (R² = 0.9987) and flux decline by analyzing time-series data from membrane operations",
    "Integration of AI with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provides critical time-dependent variables for optimizing concentration polarization, energy consumption, and temperature effects",
    "Future applications include real-time monitoring using optical coherence tomography combined with AI to enable proactive membrane maintenance and cleaning strategies"
