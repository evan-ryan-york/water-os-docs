  "title": "Capacitive Deionization (CDI): An Energy-Efficient Water Desalination Technology",
  "summary": "Capacitive deionization (CDI) is a water desalination technology that removes salt ions by applying electrical potential across porous carbon electrodes. It is particularly effective and energy-efficient for treating brackish water with low to moderate salt concentrations (below 10 g/L), as it removes ions from water rather than extracting water from salt solutions like reverse osmosis or distillation.",
  "bulletPoints": [
    "CDI works through adsorption-desorption cycles: ions are attracted to and stored in electrical double layers within porous carbon electrodes during charging, then released during regeneration when voltage is reversed or reduced to zero",
    "Membrane CDI (MCDI), introduced in 2004, improves efficiency by incorporating ion exchange membranes that prevent co-ion loss and enable more stable freshwater production with lower energy requirements than conventional CDI",
    "The technology is most cost-effective for brackish water desalination because energy costs scale with the amount of salt removed rather than water volume processed, making it competitive with reverse osmosis for low-salinity applications",
    "Large-scale CDI facilities already operate successfully, including a 10,000 tons per day plant in China achieving 75% water recovery with energy consumption of approximately 1 kWh/m³",
    "Advanced configurations include flow-through mode, flow-electrode CDI (which can handle higher salt concentrations like seawater), and ongoing research into novel electrode materials beyond activated carbon such as sodium manganese oxide and Prussian blue analogues"
