  "title": "Integration of Renewable Energy Systems in Desalination: A Comprehensive Review of Technologies and Performance (2013-2023)",
  "summary": "This review article examines the integration of renewable energy sources (solar, wind, and geothermal) with seawater and brackish water desalination technologies between 2013 and 2023. The study focuses on three primary desalination methods—Reverse Osmosis (RO), Multi-Stage Flash (MSF), and Multi-Effect Distillation (MED)—analyzing their performance indicators, energy efficiency, economic factors, and environmental impacts when coupled with renewable energy systems.",
  "bulletPoints": [
    "Traditional desalination plants rely heavily on fossil fuels, contributing to 76 million tons of CO2 emissions annually, with projections reaching 218 million tons by 2040, making renewable energy integration crucial for sustainability.",
    "Solar and geothermal energy can directly power thermal desalination systems like MSF and MED through heat supply, while wind energy requires conversion to electrical power, making it more suitable for membrane-based RO systems.",
    "Hybrid renewable energy systems combining multiple sources (e.g., PV-wind-diesel-battery configurations) provide more reliable and cost-effective solutions than single-source systems, addressing the intermittency challenges of renewable energy.",
    "The share of renewable energy in desalination was only 1% in the Middle East in 2016, but thermal desalination technologies like MSF and MED still dominate in regions with low fossil fuel costs, despite their market share declining from 84% in the 1980s to 25% by 2019.",
    "Key challenges for renewable-powered desalination include high initial capital costs, technological complexity, energy storage requirements, and the need for optimized system designs to improve energy recovery and reduce specific energy consumption."
