# Strategic Market Analysis: Assessing the Viability of Non-Revenue Water Reduction in Lusaka, Zambia

## Section 1: Executive Summary & Strategic Verdict

### 1.1 Overview of the Opportunity

This report provides a comprehensive due diligence analysis of the market entry opportunity for Water OS in Lusaka, Zambia. The core proposition is to address the city's critical Non-Revenue Water (NRW) crisis through an innovative, technology-driven model. The Lusaka Water Supply and Sanitation Company (LWSC), the state-owned utility, reports an **NRW rate of 49%**, a figure that signifies profound operational inefficiency and substantial financial loss. This level of water loss cripples the utility's financial health, limits its capacity to invest in essential maintenance and network expansion, and exacerbates water scarcity for a rapidly growing urban population.

Water OS proposes a disruptive solution that circumvents the high-capital expenditure (CapEx) and data-dependency limitations that have hindered incumbent solutions. By leveraging a combination of AI-powered digital twins, targeted IoT sensor deployment, and a performance-based **"pay-as-you-save"** commercial model, Water OS aims to deliver measurable NRW reduction without upfront cost to the utility. This presents a significant commercial opportunity that is directly aligned with pressing public needs for improved water security, utility solvency, and equitable service delivery in one of Sub-Saharan Africa's fastest-growing cities.

### 1.2 Synopsis of Key Findings

A rigorous analysis of the Lusaka market reveals a complex but compelling environment for the execution of Water OS's Phase 1 strategy.

**Strengths:** The market is uniquely primed for a technology-led intervention. The confluence of an acute and quantifiable need (49% NRW), a functional and relatively high-performing utility partner in LWSC, a remarkably mature digital payment infrastructure, and a recently modernized national legal framework for Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) creates a strong foundation for the Water OS model.

**Weaknesses:** The most significant barriers to entry are internal to the partner utility. Severe deficiencies in data quality and a persistent institutional culture at LWSC that has historically neglected data accuracy and metering represent the primary operational hurdles. These are compounded by systemic corruption risks, particularly within public procurement frameworks, and the physical limitations of an aging, intermittently supplied water network.

**Opportunities:** A successful Phase 1 execution offers a powerful demonstration effect with systemic implications. It can unlock substantial financial savings for LWSC, providing a cost-effective alternative to new capital projects. Furthermore, it can improve water access for Lusaka's vast and underserved peri-urban population, aligning Water OS directly with the strategic goals of the Zambian government, the Lusaka City Council (LCC), and major international donors active in the sector.

**Threats:** The project faces non-trivial external risks. These include the potential for political capture of the procurement process, competition from entrenched informal water markets that serve a significant portion of the population, and potential market distortion from large-scale, grant-funded donor initiatives that could undermine a commercial model.

### 1.3 Strategic Verdict

The Lusaka market presents a **high-potential but high-complexity** entry point for Water OS. The alignment of a clear, quantifiable problem (NRW) and a key enabling technology (widespread mobile money adoption) makes the Water OS model uniquely viable where traditional solutions have failed. However, the success of this venture is fundamentally contingent on the ability to navigate significant institutional weaknesses and governance challenges within the local ecosystem. Phase 1 must therefore be viewed not merely as a commercial rollout but as a critical de-risking exercise designed to validate both the technology's efficacy in a challenging environment and the viability of the partnership model with LWSC.

The strategic verdict is a **"Go, with rigorous risk mitigation."** The recommended approach is a carefully phased partnership that prioritizes data validation and builds institutional trust before attempting to scale. By proving its value in a contained pilot, Water OS can build the internal champions and objective performance data necessary to secure a long-term, performance-based contract and achieve its foundational goals in the Zambian market.

## Section 2: The Lusaka Water Market: An Environment of Acute Need and Opportunity

To fully appreciate the strategic context for Water OS's intervention, it is essential to understand the scale of the water crisis in Lusaka and the operational landscape of its primary utility, the Lusaka Water Supply and Sanitation Company (LWSC). The city's water sector is defined by a profound and widening gap between supply and demand, exacerbated by extreme inefficiency within the existing distribution network.

### 2.1 The Scale of the Non-Revenue Water Crisis

The core challenge confronting Lusaka's water system is a severe and persistent level of Non-Revenue Water. The national regulator, the National Water Supply and Sanitation Council (NWASCO), has established a sector benchmark for acceptable NRW at **25%**. However, LWSC's reported NRW rate stands at a staggering **49%**. While this is slightly better than the national average of 52.8% for commercial utilities recorded in 2020, it remains critically high and represents a massive and quantifiable inefficiency at the heart of the city's water infrastructure.

This 49% loss is a composite figure, comprising both physical and commercial losses. Physical losses stem from leaks and bursts in an aging and intermittently pressurized pipe network. Commercial losses arise from a combination of illegal connections, unmetered public use, meter inaccuracies, and systemic failures in billing and collection. A pivotal evaluation conducted by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) following its significant investment in Lusaka's water infrastructure identified a key underlying cause: a **"persistent culture of not prioritizing leaks, metering, and billing database accuracy"** within LWSC. This finding is crucial, as it suggests the problem is as much institutional and cultural as it is technical, a factor that has limited the effectiveness of past capital-intensive interventions.

The financial and social consequences of this inefficiency are severe. Globally, NRW in developing countries is estimated to cause **$5.8 billion in annual financial losses**. For LWSC, which produces approximately **250,000 cubic meters (m³) of water per day**, a 49% loss represents a massive hemorrhage of potential revenue, severely constraining its ability to fund routine maintenance, let alone capital expansion projects. Socially, this lost water could otherwise serve a significant portion of the population currently without reliable access. Studies have shown that conservation and NRW reduction can provide water at approximately **one-half to one-third of the cost** of developing new capital plants, making it the most economically rational solution to Lusaka's supply deficit.

### 2.2 The Utility Partner: Lusaka Water Supply and Sanitation Company (LWSC)

Despite its challenges, LWSC represents a viable and strategic first partner for Water OS in the region. Within the Zambian context, it is a relatively high-performing utility, having been **ranked third nationally in 2022** by the regulator, NWASCO. This ranking suggests a baseline of operational capacity and institutional structure that is superior to many of its peers, providing a more stable foundation for a partnership.

However, the utility operates under immense strain. Lusaka's daily water demand is estimated at approximately **480,000 m³**, while LWSC's current production capacity is only about **250,000 m³**. This creates a fundamental supply deficit of **230,000 m³ per day**. This deficit is then compounded by the 49% NRW rate, meaning a large fraction of the scarce water that is produced never reaches a legitimate, paying customer. The result is a system characterized by intermittent supply, with the urban average in Zambia being just **16 hours per day**. This intermittency complicates pressure management and makes conventional leak detection more difficult, posing a direct technical challenge to any NRW reduction initiative.

LWSC possesses a long and extensive history of working with major international donors and financing institutions, including the World Bank, the African Development Bank (AfDB), the European Investment Bank (EIB), GIZ, and the MCC. This history indicates a significant level of institutional experience in managing external partnerships, navigating complex project requirements, and engaging with international standards of reporting and governance. While this has not solved the underlying NRW problem, it means the utility is familiar with the mechanics of collaboration, which can facilitate the establishment of a novel partnership with Water OS. The utility's strategic plans, such as the Lusaka Water Supply Investment Master Plan, aim for **100% water and sanitation coverage by 2035**, but acknowledge a staggering capital investment gap of **US$1.28 billion**, further underscoring the urgent need for cost-effective solutions like NRW reduction.

### Table 1: Lusaka Water Sector - Key Performance Indicators

| **Indicator** | **Value** | **Strategic Implication for Water OS** |
|---------------|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| **Non-Revenue Water (NRW) Rate** | **49%** | Quantifies the core market opportunity; a high rate indicates significant potential for value creation. |
| **NWASCO NRW Benchmark** | **25%** | Provides a clear, regulator-defined target for success and a benchmark for performance-based contracting. |
| **Metering Ratio (Urban Zambia, 2010)** | **58%** | Indicates historical gaps in metering, a root cause of commercial losses and a key area for improvement. |
| **Daily Water Demand (Lusaka)** | **~480,000 m³** | Highlights the severe water scarcity, making every cubic meter of recovered water highly valuable. |
| **Daily Water Production (LWSC)** | **~250,000 m³** | Defines the total volume from which NRW losses are calculated; a constrained supply increases the urgency of efficiency. |
| **Average Hours of Supply (Urban Zambia)** | **16 hours/day** | Poses a technical challenge for leak detection but also a key metric for service improvement; reducing losses can increase supply duration. |
| **O&M Cost Coverage by Collection** | **Benchmark: 100%** | A key indicator of utility financial health; improving this through NRW reduction is a core value proposition. |

## Section 3: Analysis of Internal Factors and Local Enablers (Strengths & Weaknesses)

This section assesses the inherent characteristics of the Lusaka market and its key institutions. These factors, both positive and negative, will directly shape the operational reality and strategic execution of Water OS's Phase 1 initiative.

### 3.1 Strengths: Leveraging a Foundation for Digital Transformation

Despite its infrastructural challenges, Lusaka possesses a unique combination of digital, legal, and data assets that create a fertile ground for the Water OS model.

#### S1: Robust Digital Payment Ecosystem ("Digital Rails")

Zambia has undergone a rapid and profound digital transformation in its financial sector, creating a robust ecosystem for mobile payments. The proportion of Zambian adults actively using mobile money surged from just **14% in 2015 to 58.5% by 2020**, demonstrating widespread adoption and trust in these platforms. This trend has only accelerated, with the total value of digital transactions in the country growing by an explosive **52.4% in a single year** to reach K5.4 trillion (Zambian Kwacha) in 2024. This societal shift away from cash toward digital payments provides a mature, reliable, and highly scalable infrastructure for billing and revenue collection.

Crucially, this digital adoption extends to the utility sector. LWSC has already developed its own mobile application that allows customers to pay bills and submit meter readings, indicating an institutional acceptance of and willingness to engage with digital solutions. Furthermore, LWSC is currently undertaking a massive provincial metering exercise, aiming to install over **64,000 new meters** to shift customers from fixed-charge billing to consumption-based billing, explicitly stating a goal to ensure "accuracy and sustainability".

The existence of this digital payment ecosystem is more than a mere convenience; it represents a critical de-risking mechanism for Water OS's business model. The "pay-as-you-save" model is predicated on the ability to accurately capture and share in the financial value of recovered water. Given that LWSC's legacy billing and collection systems are themselves a source of commercial losses and data inaccuracy, relying on them would introduce significant counterparty risk. The widespread mobile money infrastructure provides an opportunity to establish a parallel financial rail. By potentially integrating directly with mobile money providers for collection from newly formalized or metered customers, Water OS can create a transparent, real-time revenue channel that bypasses the utility's potentially inefficient systems.

#### S2: Established Precedent for Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs)

LWSC has demonstrated an institutional culture that is open to collaboration with external partners, a crucial prerequisite for the Water OS model. The utility has a history of engaging in various forms of PPPs, most notably in the sanitation sector. It has successfully delegated management of water and sanitation services in peri-urban areas to community-based "Water Trusts" and has partnered with private operators for fecal sludge management (FSM) services under the donor-backed Lusaka Sanitation Project. This track record shows that the concept of delegating specific operational mandates to specialized third parties is not foreign to LWSC's leadership and management.

This institutional openness is now supported by a modernized national legal framework. In 2023, Zambia enacted a new **Public-Private Partnership Act (No. 18 of 2023)**, which was operationalized with new regulations in 2024. This legislation is explicitly designed to promote private sector participation, streamline project approvals, enhance transparency in procurement, and strengthen the overall institutional framework for PPPs. It provides a clear and contemporary legal pathway for structuring a sophisticated, performance-based contract with LWSC.

Furthermore, the national water sector regulator, NWASCO, provides a supportive regulatory environment. NWASCO's guidelines explicitly permit licensed commercial utilities like LWSC to engage third parties for service provision. The key stipulation is that all such contracts must receive prior consent from the regulator, a provision that adds a layer of transparency and oversight that can benefit a new entrant like Water OS.

#### S3: Existing Geospatial Data Assets

The creation of an AI-powered digital twin of a water network typically requires a significant upfront investment in acquiring foundational geospatial data. In Lusaka, however, a substantial portion of this foundational work has already been completed by third parties, creating a valuable asset that can significantly accelerate Water OS's deployment.

Notably, Ordnance Survey, in collaboration with the Commonwealth Association of Architects, has created a **high-resolution (20cm) digital base map of Lusaka** using AI to analyze aerial imagery. This project mapped an area of **420 km²** and identified **256,480 individual buildings**, roads, and other key features. In addition, various academic and donor-funded projects have conducted detailed geospatial analyses of the city, mapping the existing water and sanitation infrastructure, groundwater vulnerability, and cholera risk hotspots. LWSC has also undertaken its own city-wide sanitation survey and mapping exercises as part of the Lusaka Sanitation Project.

These existing data assets can serve as the foundational layers for Water OS's digital twin. Their availability dramatically reduces the initial cost and time required for data acquisition and digitization. This allows Water OS to bypass a costly and time-consuming step, focusing its resources more quickly on the core task of integrating LWSC's dynamic operational data (e.g., flow, pressure, billing records) and refining the AI model to detect anomalies.

### 3.2 Weaknesses: Navigating Institutional and Infrastructural Deficits

While the enabling environment has clear strengths, Water OS must confront profound weaknesses rooted in the utility's institutional culture, the country's governance landscape, and the physical state of the water infrastructure.

#### W1: The Data Quality Chasm

The single greatest technical and operational risk to the Water OS model is the poor quality of the data upon which its AI depends. The model's ability to accurately detect anomalies requires a baseline of reliable data on the network's physical layout, customer connections, metering, and billing. Evidence strongly suggests that LWSC's data in these areas is deeply flawed.

The MCC's post-compact evaluation is damning on this point, citing a **"persistent culture of not prioritizing... billing database accuracy"** as a primary reason why its significant investments failed to reduce NRW rates. This indicates that the problem is not a lack of awareness or resources, but a deep-seated institutional inertia. Further evidence of this can be seen in the outcomes of the MCC's institutional strengthening activities. Despite a project to conduct a census of all structures in Lusaka and update over **165,000 customer records**, the net revenue increase was a mere **3%**. The evaluation noted that the utility failed to maximize the impact of these new data and assets, for instance, by not prioritizing the installation of new meters on previously unmetered connections.

This institutional reality presents a fundamental challenge. The data deficiency is not merely a technical glitch to be fixed; it appears to be a symptom of a deeper organizational culture. Decades of reliance on external donor funding for major capital expenditures—with external financing accounting for as much as **98% of investment** in the past—may have created an environment where operational efficiency and data integrity were secondary to the primary goal of securing the next grant.

#### W2: Governance and Corruption Risks

While Zambia has a reputation for political stability, it faces significant governance challenges, particularly concerning corruption. Transparency International's 2024 Corruption Perceptions Index gives Zambia a score of **39 out of 100** (where 100 is very clean), ranking it **92nd out of 180 countries**. Although this represents a notable improvement from a score of 33 in 2022, it remains below the global average of 43 and indicates an environment where corruption is a tangible risk.

Public procurement is consistently identified as a high-risk area. It is often characterized by a lack of transparency, political interference, and inefficiencies that result in inflated costs, poor quality of works, and the misallocation of public funds. Businesses report that kickbacks and bribes in the tendering process for government contracts are common. Water OS's performance-based contract represents a novel form of procurement that emphasizes transparency and measurable outcomes. This could make it vulnerable to sabotage or manipulation by entrenched interests—both internal and external to the utility—who benefit from the status quo of opaque, input-based contracts that offer greater opportunities for graft.

#### W3: Legacy Infrastructure and Intermittent Supply

The physical state of Lusaka's water network presents a formidable technical challenge. The system is characterized by intermittent supply, with water available for an average of only **16 hours per day**. This operational mode, where the network is repeatedly pressurized and depressurized, creates significant pressure transients (water hammer effects) that stress the pipes, leading to new breaks and exacerbating existing leaks. Intermittency also makes pressure-based leak detection, a key tool in modern NRW management, far more complex to implement effectively.

The infrastructure itself is aging, with large portions of the core network requiring rehabilitation. While the Water OS model is focused on the detection of water loss, the sheer volume of physical leaks in a degraded network may be overwhelming. Resolving these leaks will ultimately require significant capital investment in pipe repair and replacement, which falls outside the scope of Water OS's Phase 1 and LWSC's current budget. This creates a potential bottleneck: Water OS may successfully identify hundreds of leaks, but if the utility lacks the capacity to repair them in a timely manner, the measured NRW reduction will be minimal, and the "pay-as-you-save" model will fail to generate revenue.

---

## Section 4: Analysis of External Factors and Strategic Pathways (Opportunities & Threats)

The success of Water OS in Lusaka will depend not only on its partnership with LWSC but also on its ability to navigate the broader external environment. This includes leveraging opportunities to create systemic value and mitigating threats from political, competitive, and social forces.

### 4.1 Opportunities: Creating and Capturing Systemic Value

The Water OS model is well-positioned to address several of Lusaka's most pressing strategic challenges, creating opportunities to generate value far beyond the direct financial returns of the contract.

#### O1: Unlocking Utility Solvency and Investment Capacity

The most immediate and quantifiable opportunity is the potential to dramatically improve LWSC's financial health. By reducing NRW, Water OS can directly increase the utility's revenue with a minimal corresponding increase in production costs. For example, a **10% reduction in NRW from 49% to 39%** on a daily production of 250,000 m³ would recover **25,000 m³ of water per day**. Once billed and collected, this represents a substantial new revenue stream.

This "virtual" source of water is exceptionally valuable from a capital planning perspective. As established in multiple studies, water sourced from NRW reduction costs only **one-half to one-third as much** as water produced from new capital plants. For a utility like LWSC, which faces a stated **US$1.28 billion investment gap** to meet its 2035 service coverage goals, efficiency gains represent the most cost-effective pathway to closing this gap.

#### O2: Bridging the Urban Service Divide

A significant opportunity lies in positioning the project as a key tool for social equity and public health. An estimated **70% of Lusaka's population** resides in peri-urban areas, many of which are informal settlements with little or no access to the formal piped water network. Residents in these areas are often forced to rely on a patchwork of expensive or contaminated alternative sources, including private boreholes, shallow wells, and water vendors. This lack of access to safe water is a primary driver of recurrent cholera outbreaks in the city.

The water recovered through NRW reduction is a fungible resource. It can be strategically redeployed by LWSC to extend network coverage into unserved peri-urban areas or to increase the hours of supply to existing water kiosks. This creates a direct, measurable, and highly visible social benefit.

#### O3: Alignment with Donor and Government Mandates

The Water OS model is exceptionally well-aligned with the stated priorities of the Zambian government and the international donor community. The government's **Eighth National Development Plan (8NDP)** and the manifesto of the ruling UPND party both prioritize achieving **universal access to water and sanitation by 2030**. A major national initiative, the **Zambia Water Investment Programme (ZIP)**, aims to mobilize **US$5.75 billion** to enhance water security, with a focus on climate resilience and job creation.

### 4.2 Threats: Mitigating Market and Political Risks

The external environment, while rich with opportunity, also contains significant threats that must be proactively managed. These range from political and governance risks to competition from both formal and informal market players.

### Table 2: Zambia Governance and Digital Readiness Scorecard

| **Indicator** | **Value/Score** | **Strategic Implication for Water OS** |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Corruption Perceptions Index (2024)** | **39/100** (Rank 92/180) | High risk in public procurement; necessitates a transparent, coalition-based approach to contracting. |
| **World Bank Political Stability Index (2023)** | **+0.20** (-2.5 to +2.5 scale) | Indicates relative macro-level stability, but does not preclude project-level political interference. |
| **Freedom House Global Freedom Score (2024)** | **53/100** ("Partly Free") | Suggests a political environment with some constraints on open competition and potential for arbitrary state action. |
| **Adult Mobile Money Usage (2020)** | **58.5%** | Strong enabler; provides a mature platform for a secure and transparent revenue collection model. |
| **Internet Penetration (2024)** | **31.2%** | Moderate penetration; sufficient for utility-level data transfer but indicates a digital divide at the consumer level. |
| **Cellular Mobile Connections vs. Population** | **78.7%** | High mobile phone ownership, underpinning the viability of mobile-based payments and communication. |

#### T1: Political Capture and Incumbent Resistance

While Zambia is considered a stable democracy with a history of peaceful transfers of power, recent reports from human rights organizations indicate a trend toward increasing authoritarianism and intolerance for dissent. This political context elevates the risk of arbitrary government action. The primary threat in this domain is political interference in the procurement process. The high perceived risk of corruption in public contracting means that a transparent, performance-based model like that of Water OS could be deliberately sidelined in favor of more traditional, input-based contracts that offer greater opportunities for patronage and graft.

#### T2: Navigating the Donor Landscape ("Donor Crowding")

The heavy presence of international donors in Lusaka's water sector is a double-edged sword. While their strategic goals are broadly aligned with Water OS's mission, their operational methods can inadvertently distort the market and create significant challenges for a commercial enterprise. The primary threat is the potential for a major donor to fund a competing NRW reduction program for LWSC on a grant basis. Such a program, offered to the utility for "free," would make it nearly impossible for a commercial, fee-based model to compete, regardless of its relative efficiency or effectiveness.

#### T3: Informal Market Dynamics and Social Resistance

A large and resilient informal water market operates in Lusaka, particularly in the peri-urban areas where 70% of the population lives. This market consists of a complex web of privately owned boreholes, community-managed water kiosks, and informal water vendors (e.g., water truckers). This decentralized system functions as a de facto competitor to the formal utility. The price of water from kiosks is regulated at approximately **1 US Cent per 20 litres**, which translates to about **$0.50 per cubic meter**, acting as a functional price ceiling for alternative supplies.

#### T4: Technology Adoption and Operational Hurdles

Finally, there are significant operational threats related to technology adoption and institutional capacity. The Water OS model relies on the deployment of IoT sensors in a challenging urban environment where the risks of vandalism and theft are non-trivial. These assets will require physical security and a robust maintenance plan. However, the more significant threat is the risk of passive resistance within the utility.

---

## Section 5: Strategic Synthesis and Recommendations for Phase 1 Execution

The preceding analysis indicates that while the opportunity in Lusaka is substantial, the risks are equally significant. A successful market entry requires a strategy that is not only technologically sound but also institutionally astute and politically aware. The following recommendations provide a framework for executing Phase 1 in a manner that systematically de-risks the venture and builds a foundation for long-term success.

### 5.1 A Framework for De-risking the LWSC Partnership

Given the profound risks associated with data quality and institutional culture, a conventional, large-scale rollout is inadvisable. A phased engagement model is required to build trust, validate data, and demonstrate value incrementally.

**Recommendation: Adopt a phased "Crawl-Walk-Run" engagement model.**

- **Crawl (Months 1-3): Data Acquisition and Validation.** The initial phase should focus exclusively on data, with no immediate expectation of NRW reduction. The primary objective is to secure access to all available network maps, historical and real-time billing records, and any existing flow and pressure data from LWSC. Water OS will use its platform to ingest this data, build the initial digital twin, and produce a comprehensive "Data Quality Audit."

- **Walk (Months 4-9): Pilot Validation in Controlled Zones.** Based on the findings of the data audit, Water OS and LWSC should jointly select one or two well-defined District Metered Areas (DMAs) to serve as pilot zones. In this phase, a minimal number of IoT sensors will be deployed to validate the digital twin's predictions against real-world conditions.

- **Run (Months 10-18): Scaled Deployment and Contract Formalization.** Contingent upon the success of the pilot phase, the solution can be scaled to additional DMAs to meet the full Phase 1 goals. The performance-based contract, which may have been provisional during the pilot, can now be formalized based on the validated data, demonstrated results, and a mutually agreed-upon baseline for NRW.

### 5.2 Navigating the Political and Procurement Landscape

To mitigate the risks of political interference and procurement challenges, Water OS must adopt a proactive and transparent strategy that leverages the existing legal and institutional frameworks to its advantage.

**Recommendation: Proactively leverage the new PPP Act of 2023.** The project should be formally framed as an unsolicited proposal under the provisions of this new legislation. This approach allows Water OS to define the terms of the engagement and highlight the unique aspects of its model—specifically its innovative, low-risk financial structure (no upfront cost to the utility) and its direct alignment with Zambia's national development goals.

**Recommendation: Build a coalition of support.** Early and direct engagement should be initiated not only with LWSC but also with the key oversight and stakeholder bodies. This includes the regulator, NWASCO, whose consent is required for third-party service contracts; the Ministry of Water Development and Sanitation, which sets national policy; and the major international donors (World Bank, AfDB) whose objectives are aligned with the project's outcomes.

### 5.3 Positioning Against the Informal Market and Donor Initiatives

Water OS must strategically position itself to avoid being perceived as a threat by local communities or being rendered commercially unviable by donor activities.

**Recommendation: Develop a clear "Pro-Poor Impact" narrative and operational plan.** The project must proactively address the social risks associated with its intervention. This should involve working with LWSC to contractually earmark a portion of the financial value generated from recovered water for specific projects in peri-urban areas.

**Recommendation: Differentiate from donor projects by emphasizing commercial sustainability.** The core value proposition to the Zambian government and LWSC should be that Water OS provides a pathway to financial independence. Unlike grant-funded projects that may perpetuate a cycle of dependency, the pay-as-you-save model is designed to build the utility's own revenue base and internal capacity.

### 5.4 Critical Success Factors and Go/No-Go Metrics for Phase 1

To ensure disciplined execution and clear decision-making, Phase 1 should be governed by a set of predefined success factors and clear metrics for completion.

**Critical Success Factors for Project Initiation:**
- **High-Level Champion:** Securing an influential and committed champion within the senior leadership of LWSC and/or the Ministry of Water Development and Sanitation.
- **Data Access:** Gaining contractual, unfettered access to raw, unfiltered utility data (billing, network, flow) necessary for the "Crawl" phase.
- **Joint Team Formation:** The formal establishment of a dedicated, joint Water OS-LWSC team with clear mandates and resources to execute the "Walk" phase pilot.
- **Legal & Regulatory Approval:** Ensuring the proposed performance-based contract structure is deemed legally sound under the PPP Act of 2023 and receives in-principle approval from the regulator, NWASCO.

**Go/No-Go Metrics for Phase 1 Completion:**
- **NRW Reduction:** Achieve a sustained, independently verifiable reduction in NRW of ≥10% from the established baseline in at least two target utility zones.
- **Revenue Generation:** Demonstrate a clear, auditable revenue stream for Water OS based on the contractual share (e.g., ~10%) of the financial value of the recovered water.
- **Contract Confirmation:** Secure a signed, multi-year, scaled performance-based contract with LWSC, based on the successful results and learnings of the pilot.
- **Stakeholder Validation:** Receive formal, positive validation of the Phase 1 results from LWSC leadership, NWASCO, and ideally, a key government or donor stakeholder.

Achievement of these metrics will signify the successful completion of Phase 1, confirming the viability of the Water OS model in Lusaka and providing a firm foundation for future expansion.
