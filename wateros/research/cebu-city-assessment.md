# Project Water OS: A Strategic Viability Assessment of Cebu City as a Pilot Market

## Executive Summary & Strategic Recommendation

This report presents a comprehensive viability assessment of Cebu City, Philippines, as the proposed pilot market for the Water OS "NRW Recovery & Resilience Package." The analysis indicates that Cebu City represents a high-potential, albeit complex, entry point. The severity of the water crisis, characterized by a Non-Revenue Water (NRW) rate exceeding 36%, creates a powerful and urgent market need. This is amplified by intense political pressure from a new municipal administration actively seeking innovative, third-party solutions to what it frames as a crisis of mismanagement. While significant institutional risks exist, primarily related to bureaucratic inertia and political infighting surrounding the Metropolitan Cebu Water District (MCWD), these are substantially mitigated by the Water OS performance-based, zero-upfront-cost business model. This model aligns directly with the political imperative for transparent, results-driven reform.

The city's robust technical and financial infrastructure, including a mature digital payments ecosystem and an existing SCADA data network, significantly de-risks the operational and revenue-verification aspects of the pilot. Furthermore, a favorable founder environment—characterized by high English proficiency, a thriving tech ecosystem, and a history of public-private partnerships—suggests that Cebu City can serve not just as a testbed, but as a scalable, long-term operational hub. The overall assessment points to a compelling opportunity.

**Strategic Recommendation: Proceed with Caution.** The market conditions are highly favorable, but successful entry requires a politically astute strategy that bypasses initial engagement with the water utility's entrenched leadership and instead forges a primary alliance with the reform-minded Cebu City Mayor's Office. The single greatest opportunity lies in positioning Water OS as the key technological enabler for the new administration's public commitment to fixing the water crisis. The most critical risk is becoming entangled in the ongoing political conflict between the city government and the MCWD board, which could stall project approval and implementation.

## The Cebu City Water Crisis: A Market Opportunity Analysis

This section analyzes the severity and urgency of the water crisis in Cebu City, evaluating the core problem that the Water OS solution is designed to address. The assessment covers the quantifiable scale of the Non-Revenue Water (NRW) crisis, its tangible impact on households and their willingness to pay for solutions, and the resulting political and public pressure for immediate action.

### 1.1 Specifics of NRW Crisis

**Score: 5 (Critical, >40%)**

**Justification:** The Non-Revenue Water (NRW) situation in Cebu City, managed by the Metropolitan Cebu Water District (MCWD), is not merely a persistent issue but a critical and escalating crisis. The data reveals a consistent upward trend in water losses that far surpasses the nationally mandated regulatory limits. In 2020, MCWD's NRW stood at 25.26%, already above the 20% maximum acceptable level set by the Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA) in 2009. This figure worsened to 29.04% in 2021 and climbed further to 32.67% in 2022.² More recent reports from 2024, cited by both LWUA and the Cebu City Mayor, indicate the NRW rate has reached a staggering 36%.¹ This places the crisis firmly in the most severe category of the evaluation rubric.

The financial consequences of this operational failure are immense and directly threaten the utility's solvency. The Commission on Audit (COA) has repeatedly flagged MCWD for these losses, noting that "no marked improvement was observed" over a three-year period. The financial hemorrhage is quantifiable and growing: the loss in revenue was P63.4 million in 2020, P116.1 million in 2021, and a staggering P173.8 million (approximately USD 3 million) in 2022.² The average annual loss due to NRW was calculated at P117.759 million (approximately USD 2 million) for that period.¹ This is particularly damaging as MCWD is a self-sustaining entity that does not receive subsidies from the national government, meaning its entire operational budget and capacity for capital investment depend on the revenue it generates from water sales.²

This situation has created a classic self-perpetuating cycle of decay. The massive financial losses incurred from NRW are precisely the funds that MCWD would need to invest in large-scale rehabilitation, pipeline replacement, and infrastructure upgrades—the very actions required to reduce NRW.²⁶ The inability to fund these crucial projects due to poor revenue collection ensures that the aging infrastructure continues to deteriorate, leading to even higher NRW rates and greater financial losses in the subsequent years. This vicious cycle presents a clear and urgent pain point that is perfectly suited for the Water OS performance-based model, which breaks the cycle by injecting the necessary technology and capital for repairs, funded directly by the value of the recovered water.

### 1.2 Household Impact & Willingness to Pay

**Score: 5 (Severe, chronic rationing, high vendor premiums)**

**Justification:** The operational and financial crisis at MCWD translates directly into a severe, tangible crisis for the households and businesses it is meant to serve. The water supply is characterized by chronic intermittency and inadequacy, falling far short of meeting the population's needs. Even in 1998, MCWD's piped system served only 23% of households for an average of 18 hours per day.²⁷ The situation has since deteriorated, particularly under environmental stress. In April 2024, the impact of the El Niño phenomenon became so acute that the Cebu City government was forced to declare a state of calamity, with 28 mountain barangays being the most severely affected.³

Residents in affected areas describe a daily struggle for water. They face persistent rationing schedules, with water often available only for a few hours late at night, forcing them to disrupt their sleep to fill every available container.³ Some areas have experienced daily interruptions from 11 pm to 3 am for over a year.²⁹ Even when water is flowing, it is often at low pressure, particularly in elevated and remote areas.⁵ To cope with these shortages, MCWD has resorted to deploying water tankers to inject water directly into distribution lines in the hardest-hit neighborhoods.³⁰ This is a clear indicator of a system under severe strain, unable to fulfill its basic service mandate.

This profound service deficit has created a robust parallel market for water, demonstrating a high willingness to pay for reliability. Research indicates that private water markets, including vended water, cater to at least 30% of Metro Cebu households.⁴ Consumers purchase water from neighbors with private wells, from water delivery trucks, and from bottled water suppliers, often at significant premiums that reflect not only distribution costs but also "monopoly profits".⁴ The existence of numerous private water delivery services marketing 24/7 availability ³² and the sale of expensive home filtration systems ³⁴ further confirm that residents are willing and able to pay for reliable access to clean water. This reality is crucial for the Water OS model. The value of the water to be recovered is not just its subsidized tariff rate, but its significantly higher market value as a reliable, consistently available resource. By enabling MCWD to serve these currently underserved or unserved customers, Water OS is not just saving costs but unlocking substantial new revenue streams, strengthening the financial justification for its 10-15% revenue share.

### 1.3 Public & Political Pressure

**Score: 5 (Intense pressure, top political priority)**

**Justification:** The water crisis in Cebu City has transcended being an operational issue and has become a matter of intense public concern and a top-tier political priority. The public discourse is one of urgency and crisis, with civil society, business leaders, and government officials convening for high-profile summits like "WaterLogues" to address the "looming crisis" head-on, framing it as an existential threat to Cebu's people, economy, and future.³⁵ This public outcry is amplified by the city's dual struggle with both water scarcity and severe flooding, creating a narrative of comprehensive water management failure that demands immediate and effective solutions.³⁶

This public pressure has been fully embraced by the city's political leadership. In a highly public move, the Mayor of Cebu City officially declared a state of water crisis in April 2024.³ Following the midterm elections, the new administration under Mayor Nestor Archival has made resolving the water issue a central plank of its agenda.³⁸ The appointment of the influential and outspoken Vice Mayor, Tomas Osmeña, as the city's "water czar" is a powerful signal of this commitment.⁵ Osmeña has publicly and repeatedly called for a "complete overhaul" of the MCWD board and management, citing "incompetence," "very alarming anomalies," and "major signs of corruption".⁶

This political climate creates an exceptionally rare window of opportunity. The city's leadership is not merely applying pressure; it is actively seeking external solutions and allies to bypass what it perceives as an intransigent and ineffective utility management. Vice Mayor Osmeña has stated explicitly that he considers MCWD "useless" and is coordinating directly with the national regulator, LWUA, because of a lack of transparency at the local utility.³⁹ This indicates an active search for a partner who can deliver results and validate the new administration's reformist platform. For Water OS, this means the path of least resistance may not be through a conventional approach to the utility itself, but through a strategic alignment with a powerful political champion in the Mayor's office who is actively looking for a technology-driven, transparent, and performance-based solution to a high-stakes political problem.

## Navigating the Institutional Labyrinth: Governance, Risk, and Partnership Potential

This section evaluates the institutional landscape of Cebu City, a critical factor for a partnership-based business model. It assesses the agility of government and utility bodies, the risks posed by corruption and entrenched interests, the historical precedent for external collaborations, and the presence of international funders, which together determine the feasibility of establishing a successful pilot.

### 2.1 Government & Utility Agility

**Score: 3 (Agile & Innovative "Smart City" focus at the political level, but Rigid & Bureaucratic at the utility operational level)**

**Justification:** Cebu City presents a paradox of agility. At the highest political levels, there is a clear and stated ambition to be an innovative, technology-forward "Smart City." This vision is primarily focused on tackling urban challenges like traffic congestion through large-scale projects such as an automated citywide traffic control system and a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system.⁷ This demonstrates a willingness among the city's leadership to embrace and invest in complex, technology-driven solutions to improve urban livability and efficiency. This high-level strategic orientation is a positive indicator for Water OS, as it provides a receptive political audience for a "Smart Water" initiative.

However, this forward-looking vision is starkly contrasted by a state of bureaucratic paralysis and operational rigidity within the water sector, specifically concerning the relationship between the city government and MCWD. The implementation of critical water infrastructure projects has been severely hampered by political infighting. For instance, essential excavation permits for water expansion projects in upland barangays were stalled for over a year due to "political disagreements" between the previous mayor and the MCWD board chairman.⁹ Similarly, the development of much-needed desalination plants has been subject to significant delays attributed to bureaucracy.⁸

The key bottleneck appears to be the dysfunctional governance structure and the politicized nature of the MCWD board, rather than a fundamental institutional aversion to new projects or technology. This is evidenced by the fact that when a new acting mayor assumed office, the stalled excavation permits were signed almost immediately, unlocking the delayed projects.⁹ This suggests that agility is highly dependent on political alignment. For Water OS, this bifurcated reality requires a nuanced strategy. The institutional readiness score is moderate because while the utility itself is operationally rigid, the political leadership's desire for innovation is high. The path to success lies in targeting the political visionaries—the Mayor's office and the "water czar"—and framing the Water OS package as a flagship "Smart Water" project that aligns with their existing agenda. This top-down political support is essential to compel the slower-moving utility bureaucracy to act.

### 2.2 Corruption & Entrenched Operators

**Score: 2 (High Risk, politically captured by vested interests)**

**Justification:** The operating environment in Cebu City and the Philippines presents a high risk of corruption, which requires careful navigation. Nationally, the Philippines scores a low 33 out of 100 on the 2024 Corruption Perceptions Index, ranking 114th out of 180 countries, indicating a systemic challenge with public sector corruption.¹⁰ This national context is reflected in specific and public allegations leveled at the local water utility.

High-ranking city officials, including the Vice Mayor, have publicly alleged "major signs of corruption," "very alarming anomalies," and "overpriced supply deals" within MCWD.⁶ These are not vague accusations; they are often tied to specific issues, such as the procurement of bulk water and the awarding of joint venture contracts. The national water regulator, LWUA, lent credence to these concerns when it intervened in MCWD's affairs, citing a review from the Office of the Government Corporate Counsel that found proceedings for certain joint venture agreements to be "highly irregular, grossly inexcusable, [and] tantamount to bad faith".¹¹ This points to a risk of political capture, where procurement processes may be influenced by entrenched interests rather than technical or financial merit.

It is important to distinguish the nature of this risk. The research provides no evidence of a violent, infrastructure-sabotaging "water mafia" as has been documented in other developing countries.⁴² The primary threat in Cebu is not physical but bureaucratic and financial. The risk for a new partner like Water OS is not sabotage, but the potential for projects to be stalled by vested interests who benefit from the opaque status quo (e.g., existing bulk water suppliers with favorable contracts), or facing demands for illicit payments to navigate the procurement process.

However, the Water OS business model provides a powerful, inherent mitigation to this specific type of risk. The "zero upfront cost" element bypasses the traditional capital budget procurement process, which is often a primary locus for corruption. Furthermore, the performance-based revenue model, which relies on a share of the verified monetary value of recovered water, introduces a level of radical transparency that is antithetical to corrupt practices. It is difficult to inflate costs or hide non-performance when payment is tied directly to a transparently measured outcome. This structure can turn a potential vulnerability into a strategic advantage, positioning Water OS as a clean, transparent alternative to the "highly irregular" practices of the past.

### 2.3 History of Partnering with Startups/Pilots

**Score: 4 (Open, documented partnerships with diverse external entities)**

**Justification:** Despite its internal governance challenges, MCWD has a strong and well-documented history of engaging with a wide array of external partners, indicating a fundamental institutional openness to collaboration. The utility does not operate in isolation and has demonstrated a capacity to form and manage complex partnerships with entities ranging from large multinational corporations to non-governmental organizations. This track record significantly de-risks the prospect of forming a new partnership with Water OS.

MCWD's collaborations include:

-   **Major Technology Implementation:** The utility undertook a significant project with Yokogawa, a major Japanese engineering and technology company, to install a comprehensive Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. This project involved deploying field instruments at 143 locations and implementing sophisticated water leakage management software, demonstrating a capacity to adopt advanced technology from an external provider.¹²
-   **Capital-Intensive Joint Ventures:** MCWD entered into a 25-year joint venture agreement with Vivant Hydrocore Holdings Inc. for the construction and operation of a 20 million liter per day (MLD) seawater desalination plant. This partnership followed a formal Competitive Selection Process and resulted in a long-term public-private partnership (PPP) to augment the city's water supply.¹⁴
-   **International NGO and Development Partnerships:** The utility has engaged in a PPP with the Netherlands-based VEI and the French NGO Eau et Vie. This project specifically targets pro-poor water supply, aiming to expand the water network into slum areas and connect tens of thousands of the poorest residents through innovative micro-financing schemes.¹³
-   **Peer-to-Peer Knowledge Sharing:** MCWD is recognized as a leader among Philippine water districts. It is classified as a "very large" and progressive utility and serves as a "Big Brother Water District," hosting benchmarking visits from other utilities, such as the Metro Tuguegao Water District, to share best practices in operations and digitization.⁴⁴

This history suggests that the institutional DNA for collaboration exists within MCWD. The personnel and processes required to negotiate contracts, manage joint projects, and integrate external technologies are in place. While there is no specific evidence of partnerships with early-stage startups, the diversity of their existing partners indicates a pragmatic approach focused on solving problems rather than an ideological preference for only working with large, established players. The primary challenge for Water OS will not be to convince MCWD of the merit of external partnerships, but to navigate the current political turmoil at the board level to secure approval for a new agreement. The existence of these strong precedents provides a clear and legitimate pathway for such a proposal.

### 2.4 Existing Interest from Funders

**Score: 5 (High interest, multiple active water projects from World Bank, ADB, etc.)**

**Justification:** Cebu City is a focal point for major Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) operating in the Philippine water sector. The sustained, large-scale, and long-term engagement from premier organizations like the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the World Bank signals the strategic importance of the region and validates the critical nature of its water challenges. This active DFI presence creates a highly favorable environment for the "Water OS Recovery Fund" and the overall pilot project.

Key DFI activities in Cebu include:

-   **Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA):** JICA is spearheading a monumental initiative, the "Master Plan Study for Comprehensive Sewerage System Development in Metro Cebu." This is a multi-year project running from 2024 to 2027, with a budget of 315 million Japanese yen, aimed at designing a modern, centralized sewerage system for over three million residents across eight municipalities.¹⁶ MCWD is designated as the official Execution Agency for this massive undertaking, placing it at the center of one of the largest infrastructure planning projects in the region.⁴⁵
-   **Asian Development Bank (ADB):** The ADB has a multi-decade relationship with MCWD. As far back as 1990, the ADB funded the "Metropolitan Cebu Water Supply Project," with one of its specific goals being the reduction of NRW from 38% to 30%.⁴⁷ More recently, the ADB has been partnering with MCWD to introduce integrated water resources management (IWRM) for Central Cebu's critical river basins, demonstrating a continued commitment to improving the region's overall water security.¹⁵
-   **World Bank:** The World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program has been active in the Philippines, focusing on institutional reforms, improving utility governance, and financing for "last mile" service delivery. Notably, their past work included a specific focus on Cebu, where they conducted a census of small water providers as part of an effort to improve the regulatory framework for the entire sector.⁵⁰

The presence of these globally respected institutions creates a powerful "halo effect." Their extensive due diligence and long-term financial commitments implicitly de-risk the operating environment for other investors, including the impact investors backing the Water OS Recovery Fund. There is also a strong strategic alignment; a multi-billion dollar sewerage system, as envisioned by JICA, cannot function efficiently if the water distribution network supplying it is losing over a third of its input to leakage. Water OS can position its NRW reduction work as a critical, complementary, and enabling investment that enhances the viability and efficiency of these larger DFI-backed projects, making the entire water system more sustainable and bankable.

## Technical & Financial Infrastructure: Assessing Foundational Readiness

This section examines the underlying technical and financial systems in Cebu City that are essential for the successful implementation and scaling of the Water OS model. The analysis focuses on the maturity of digital payment systems, which is critical for revenue verification, and the availability and quality of existing utility data, which is foundational to the initial "See It" phase of the project.

### 3.1 Adoption of Digital Payment Systems

**Score: 5 (Ubiquitous, >60% penetration, trusted for utilities)**

**Justification:** The Philippines has undergone a rapid and widespread digital transformation in its financial sector, creating a highly favorable environment for a business model that relies on transparent revenue verification. The adoption of digital payments is not a nascent trend but a mainstream reality. As of 2024, digital transactions account for 57.4% of the total volume of retail payments in the country, a figure that has already surpassed the government's ambitious target of 50%.¹⁷ This surge is driven by strong consumer preference and a supportive government policy, with over 25 million households now actively using mobile payment platforms.¹⁷

Crucially, this digital adoption extends directly to the utility sector. Consumers are increasingly using mobile apps and online platforms to settle their bills for electricity, water, and internet, moving away from traditional cash-based payment centers.¹⁷ This shift provides a clear, auditable, and transparent trail of payments from the consumer to the utility.

This mature digital payment ecosystem is a critical, though not immediately obvious, enabler of the Water OS business model. The model's viability hinges on the ability to receive a 10-15% share of the verified monetary value of recovered water. In a cash-dominant system, verifying revenue collection is notoriously difficult, opaque, and susceptible to leakage, posing a significant risk to any performance-based contract. The high penetration of digital utility payments in the Philippines effectively solves this problem. It creates an electronic record of each transaction, allowing for a simple and irrefutable audit of the revenue generated from the additional water supplied to customers. This dramatically de-risks the revenue-sharing component of the model for both Water OS and its impact investors, ensuring that the value created is accurately measured and transparently shared.

### 3.2 Water Utility Data Availability

**Score: 4 (Data exists, some form of digital maps, billing records, etc.)**

**Justification:** The Metropolitan Cebu Water District is not operating with a purely analog, paper-based system. The utility has made a significant prior investment in a foundational digital infrastructure for network monitoring, which provides a substantial head start for the Water OS "See It" phase. MCWD partnered with the Japanese technology firm Yokogawa to implement a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system across its network.¹² This system is not rudimentary; it actively monitors 143 key locations, including dams, reservoirs, pressure points, water pump stations, and District Metered Areas (DMAs).¹²

The explicit purpose of this SCADA implementation was to enable better water leakage management. The system is designed to collect and transfer data on flow and pressure to a central office, where specialized software calculates the minimum night flow (between 2:00 am and 4:00 am) to estimate the level of water leakage within each DMA.¹² The former General Manager of MCWD, Stephen Yee, praised the system for making the utility more "efficient and effective in its day-to-day operations especially in handling NRW".¹² This confirms that a rich dataset of historical and real-time flow and pressure data—the core inputs for identifying anomaly hotspots—already exists in a digital format.

While the research does not confirm the existence of a complete, modern GIS-based digital twin of the entire pipe network, there is a clear precedent for such systems within Philippine water districts. Mabalacat City Water District, for example, successfully digitized its mainlines, valves, hydrants, and customer service connections, integrating them with a hydraulic model.⁵¹ Furthermore, MCWD demonstrates a level of data governance by responding to Freedom of Information (FOI) requests for historical data, indicating that formal processes for data access are in place.⁵²

This existing data infrastructure fundamentally changes the nature of the initial phase of the Water OS project. The task is not to create a digital view of the network from scratch, which would be a time-consuming and arduous process. Instead, the "See It" phase will involve ingesting, cleansing, and augmenting this existing SCADA dataset with satellite imagery and AI analytics. This dramatically accelerates the timeline for identifying high-value "anomaly hotspots" and increases the likelihood of delivering accurate, actionable intelligence to the utility in the first three months of the pilot, a crucial step for building momentum and credibility as a resource-constrained startup.

## Founder & Operational Feasibility: The On-the-Ground Environment

This section evaluates the practical, on-the-ground conditions in Cebu City from the perspective of a solo founder. It assesses factors that directly impact the ease and efficiency of establishing and running a pilot operation, including language accessibility, the overall business and safety environment, and the strength of the local talent pool and innovation ecosystem.

### 4.1 English as an Accessible Language

**Score: 5 (Widely accessible, language of business)**

**Justification:** The linguistic environment in Cebu City is exceptionally favorable and represents a significant operational advantage. English is not merely a tourist language but is a co-official language of the Philippines, deeply integrated into the fabric of society. It is the primary language used in formal settings, including business, government, the legal system, and higher education.²⁰ This removes what is often a major barrier to market entry for foreign founders.

The Philippines consistently ranks among the most English-proficient countries in Asia and globally. In 2023, it was ranked #2 in Asia and #22 worldwide in the English Proficiency Index (EPI).²⁰ An estimated 55% of the adult Filipino population speaks English, with a much larger proportion possessing strong reading and writing comprehension.²⁰ Cebu City, specifically, scores very highly, with an EPI score of 581, categorizing its proficiency level as "High".²⁰ This level of proficiency (equivalent to a CEFR B2 level) means that the local population can communicate with ease, nuance, and efficiency, even on complex topics.²⁰

For a solo founder, this widespread English proficiency eliminates an entire layer of operational friction, cost, and risk. Every critical task—from negotiating the fine points of a partnership agreement with MCWD's lawyers and executives, to conducting technical deep-dives with utility engineers, to hiring and managing local field staff, to navigating everyday logistics—can be conducted directly and efficiently in English. There is no need for translators, no risk of critical details being "lost in translation," and no barrier to building strong working relationships with local stakeholders. This accessibility dramatically accelerates the entire pilot setup process, directly supporting the goal of achieving a revenue-generating operation within the 18-24 month timeframe.

### 4.2 Founder Logistics (Ease of Doing Business)

**Score: 4 (Very favorable, stable, safe, easy visas)**

**Justification:** Cebu City offers a highly favorable logistical environment for a resource-constrained founder establishing a new venture. The combination of a welcoming business climate, personal safety, and low operational costs creates a stable launchpad for the Water OS pilot.

The Philippine government actively encourages foreign investment and has established legal frameworks for foreigners to form and operate businesses.²¹ While this requires navigating regulatory processes, such as reviewing the Foreign Investment Negative List (FINL) and securing the necessary permits and visas, these are well-defined procedures rather than insurmountable obstacles.⁵⁴ The cost of doing business is a significant advantage, with wages, communication, and housing costs being substantially lower than in the U.S. and other Western countries, which extends the financial runway of a lean startup.²¹

From a personal safety perspective, Cebu is considered relatively secure, particularly when compared to other major metropolitan areas in Southeast Asia.²² The primary risks to foreigners are non-violent petty crimes, such as pickpocketing or taxi scams, which are concentrated in crowded downtown areas and can be effectively mitigated through standard situational awareness and common-sense precautions.²² There is no evidence of significant political instability, civil unrest, or targeted crime against foreign business operators that would pose a systemic threat to the pilot's operations. The environment is stable and predictable, allowing a founder to focus on business execution rather than navigating existential safety threats. This combination of a structured, pro-business legal framework, low operating costs, and a safe, stable living environment makes Cebu an advantageous and practical choice for establishing the first Water OS pilot.

### 4.3 Broader Environment (Talent & Ecosystem)

**Score: 4 (Thriving tech hub, strong universities)**

**Justification:** Cebu City is not an isolated market but a dynamic and burgeoning technology hub with a supportive ecosystem that can significantly contribute to the success and scalability of the Water OS pilot. The city's innovation landscape is anchored by a young, tech-savvy workforce, a network of strong universities, and growing institutional support from both government and the private sector.²³

The local startup ecosystem is vibrant and well-established. It hosts major tech conferences like "Geeks on a Beach," which convenes hundreds of founders, technology experts, and venture capitalists, providing a forum for networking and knowledge sharing.²⁴ There is a growing presence of homegrown venture capital firms and angel investor groups, indicating an increasing availability of local capital.²⁴ Community organizations like TechTalks.ph serve as crucial connectors, hosting regular meetups that bring together entrepreneurs, developers, designers, and investors to share ideas and foster collaboration.⁵⁶ This community provides an invaluable resource for a new market entrant seeking local knowledge, partnerships, and talent.

The talent pipeline is robust, supported by strong local academic institutions. The University of San Carlos, for example, is not only a source of engineering and science graduates but also houses specialized research facilities like the USC Water Laboratory, which is accredited by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and the Department of Health (DOH) and provides analytical services to government and industry.⁵⁸ This indicates a local pool of technical expertise relevant to the water sector.

This ecosystem offers more than just a problem to solve; it provides the resources to build a scalable company. This is a critical consideration for the long-term, 20-year vision of building a global "Water OS." Cebu could serve not only as the initial pilot location but as a strategic Asia-Pacific headquarters. Water OS could leverage the local talent pool to hire software engineers, data scientists, and field technicians at a competitive cost, build partnerships through the local tech community, and potentially attract follow-on funding from the growing regional investment scene. This makes Cebu a potential long-term launchpad, not just a short-term testbed.

## Strategic Synthesis & The Path Forward

The comprehensive analysis of Cebu City reveals a market defined by a powerful convergence of acute need and political will. The water crisis is not a background issue; it is a severe, quantifiable, and escalating problem that directly impacts citizens and has become a central focus of a new, reform-minded political administration. This creates an environment of extreme urgency that is highly conducive to a solution like the Water OS "NRW Recovery & Resilience Package." The utility's financial paralysis, caused by the very NRW it cannot afford to fix, makes the zero-upfront-cost, performance-based model exceptionally compelling.

The primary challenge is not technical or financial, but institutional. The Metropolitan Cebu Water District is caught in a political struggle, leading to bureaucratic gridlock that has stalled critical projects. However, this challenge also defines the path of least resistance. The new city administration, led by Mayor Nestor Archival and "water czar" Vice Mayor Tomas Osmeña, is actively seeking to break this impasse and has publicly positioned itself against the current utility leadership. They are looking for transparent, results-driven solutions that can deliver a visible win and validate their reformist agenda.

Therefore, the recommended market entry strategy is to bypass initial engagement with the MCWD board and instead forge a primary alliance with the Cebu City Mayor's Office. The Water OS value proposition should be framed not merely as a technical tool for NRW reduction, but as a strategic instrument of good governance. It offers a transparent, data-driven, and performance-based mechanism to solve a major public crisis, aligning perfectly with the administration's political objectives. By securing top-down political championship, Water OS can leverage the Mayor's authority to mandate cooperation from the utility, cutting through the bureaucratic and political inertia.

Looking beyond the initial pilot, Cebu City presents a strong foundation for the long-term "Water OS" vision. The combination of a critical water problem, a thriving local tech ecosystem with a deep talent pool, high English proficiency, and a strategic location at the heart of Southeast Asia makes it an ideal candidate for a regional headquarters. The significant, long-term presence of major development finance institutions like JICA and the ADB further solidifies its importance as a hub for water innovation. By successfully executing the pilot, Water OS can establish a powerful case study and a scalable operational base from which to expand across the Philippines and the wider region.

## The Engagement Playbook: Key Contacts and Ecosystem Players

This section provides a targeted list of key individuals and organizations for initial outreach in Cebu City. The list is structured to align with the recommended strategy of engaging political champions first, followed by regulatory bodies, funders, and local ecosystem connectors.

### A. Potential Institutional Champions (People)

| **Name** | **Title** | **Organization** | **Rationale for Contact** |
|:---------|:----------|:-----------------|:--------------------------|
| **Nestor Archival** | Mayor | Cebu City Government | As the newly elected Mayor ³⁸, he has publicly warned of MCWD's potential bankruptcy and made solving the water crisis a key priority. He is the ultimate political champion needed to sponsor and fast-track the pilot project.⁵ |
| **Tomas Osmeña** | Vice Mayor & "Water Czar" | Cebu City Government | Designated by the Mayor to oversee all water-related issues, he is actively calling for a "complete overhaul" of MCWD due to alleged mismanagement and corruption. He is the primary operational champion and point of contact within the city government for a reform-oriented solution.⁵ |
| **Edgar H. Donoso** | General Manager | Metropolitan Cebu Water District (MCWD) | As the head of operations at the utility, his buy-in is essential for the technical implementation of the pilot. He has overseen partnerships with JICA and other external entities.¹⁶ Initial contact should likely be made after securing political support from the Mayor's office. |
| **(Vacant/To Be Identified)** | Head of NRW Management / Operations / Engineering | Metropolitan Cebu Water District (MCWD) | This individual (or department head) will be the key technical counterpart for the "Understand It" and "Fix It" phases. Identification of this person would be a key goal of initial meetings with the General Manager. A manager named John Makabenta has been identified as head of corporate planning and has spoken on NRW issues.²⁵ |

### B. Key Governmental & Utility Bodies (Organizations)

| **Organization Name** | **Website** | **Role & Relevance** |
|:----------------------|:------------|:---------------------|
| **Metropolitan Cebu Water District (MCWD)** | https://www.mcwd.gov.ph/ | The primary city water utility and the direct partner for the "NRW Recovery & Resilience Package." It serves Metro Cebu and is the owner of the infrastructure to be digitized and repaired.⁶¹ |
| **Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA)** | http://www.lwua.gov.ph/ | The national-level specialized lending and regulatory institution for provincial water districts. LWUA has the authority to intervene in MCWD's affairs (and has done so), sets NRW standards, and is a key stakeholder that the Mayor's office is coordinating with directly.¹¹ |
| **National Water Resources Board (NWRB)** | https://www.nwrb.gov.ph/ | The national agency for water resources policy, regulation, and quasi-judicial functions. It is responsible for issuing water permits and regulating tariffs for water districts, making it a key part of the national governance framework.⁶⁶ |

### C. Funding & Donor Ecosystem (Funders)

| **Funder Name** | **Flagship Project Impacting Cebu** | **Relevance to Water OS** |
|:----------------|:-------------------------------------|:--------------------------|
| **Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)** | Master Plan Study for Comprehensive Sewerage System Development in Metro Cebu (2024-2027) ¹⁶ | JICA's massive investment in a sewerage system creates a powerful strategic synergy. Reducing NRW is critical to the efficiency and viability of the future sewerage network. Aligning with this project could unlock future funding and partnerships. |
| **Asian Development Bank (ADB)** | Metropolitan Cebu Water Supply Project (historical, focused on NRW reduction) & Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) for MKCL river basins (ongoing) ¹⁵ | The ADB has a long history of funding NRW reduction in Cebu and remains an active partner with MCWD. Their institutional knowledge and ongoing presence validate the importance of the problem and make them a key potential partner for scaling the Recovery Fund. |
| **World Bank** | Expanded Small Water Utilities Improvement and Financing (ESWIF) Program ⁵⁰ | While not currently running a major capital project in Cebu, the World Bank is deeply involved in institutional reform and governance in the Philippine water sector. Their focus on utility performance and "last mile" service makes them a key influencer and potential source of technical assistance or future funding. |
