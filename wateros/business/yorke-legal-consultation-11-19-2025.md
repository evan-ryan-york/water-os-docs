## 🇬🇭 Strategic Roadmap: Ghana Market Entry

**Project:** Clearwater Africa | **Role:** Foreign Founder (US)

**Core Strategy:** "Pure SaaS" Pivot (Avoid FinTech Status)

### 1. The Strategic Pivot

To retain 100% equity (or 90% with a partner) and avoid the Bank of Ghana's 30% local equity mandate, you are changing your business classification.

**Old Model (FinTech):** You process payments, hold funds in a wallet, and pay drivers.
- **Risk:** Requires "Enhanced PSP License" + 30% Ghanaian Equity + GHS 2M Integrity Capital.

**New Model (Tech Service Provider):** You provide the software. Paystack processes the payments.
- **Mechanism:** Use Paystack's Split Payment API.
- **Flow:** Customer pays → Paystack → [Driver 90% / You 10%].
- **Benefit:** You never hold funds. You are exempt from Bank of Ghana PSP licensing.

### 2. Corporate Structure Options

You have two viable paths to satisfy the Ghana Investment Promotion Centre (GIPC).

**Option A: The "Clean" Joint Venture (Recommended)**
- **Structure:** 90% You (US) / 10% Local Partner (Ghanaian).
- **Capital Requirement:** $200,000 USD (Cash or Capital Goods).
- **Pros:** Lower capital barrier; fully compliant; "investor ready" structure.
- **Cons:** You must trust the 10% partner (though they have no veto power).

**Option B: The "Wholly Foreign" Route**
- **Structure:** 100% You (US Entity or Individual).
- **Capital Requirement:** $500,000 USD (Cash or Capital Goods).
- **Pros:** Absolute control; no partner needed.
- **Cons:** Extremely high upfront capital proof required.

**⚠️ The "Trust" Workaround (The Grey Area):**
- **Strategy:** A Ghanaian holds 100% shares but signs a "Trust Agreement" saying you are the beneficial owner.
- **Risk:** Ghana is cracking down on "fronting." If a dispute arises, this contract may be unenforceable. Use only as a last resort.

### 3. The Profit Repatriation Mechanism

Since you are a US-owned business, you need a legal way to move profits from Ghana back to the US without being double-taxed or blocked by the Central Bank.

**The Tool:** Technology Transfer Agreement (TTA).

**How it works:** Your US entity "licenses" the software to the Ghana entity.
- **The Fee:** You charge the Ghana entity a "Royalty" or "Technical Service Fee" (capped at 0–6% of net sales).
- **Critical Step:** You MUST register this agreement with the GIPC.
- **Duration:** Min 18 months / Max 10 years.
- **Warning:** An unregistered TTA is unenforceable; banks will refuse to wire the funds to the US.

### 4. Operational Order of Events (The "Timeline")

You cannot do Step 4 without Step 2. Do not skip ahead.

**Phase 1: Legal Formation (Months 1-2)**

1. **[ ] Incorporation:** Register Clearwater Ghana Ltd. with the Registrar General's Department (RGD).
   - **Deliverable:** Certificate of Incorporation & Beneficial Ownership Profile.

2. **[ ] Tax Registration:** Register with Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA).
   - **Deliverable:** Tax Identification Number (TIN).

3. **[ ] GIPC Registration:** Submit RGD docs + Proof of Capital ($200k/$500k).
   - **Action:** Wire the capital to your corporate account OR provide supplier invoices for capital goods (trucks/servers) worth that amount.
   - **Deliverable:** GIPC Certificate (The "Golden Key").

**Phase 2: Market Access (Month 3)**

4. **[ ] Banking:** Open full corporate accounts (Standard Chartered, Stanbic, or Ecobank).
   - **Requirement:** They will demand the GIPC Certificate from Step 3.

5. **[ ] Payments:** Activate Paystack Corporate Account.
   - **Requirement:** Upload RGD + GIPC Certificates.

6. **[ ] Immigration:** Apply for Work & Residence Permits for yourself.
   - **Requirement:** Automatic quota is given based on your GIPC capital amount.

**Phase 3: Operations (Month 4+)**

7. **[ ] Employment:** Register with SSNIT (Social Security) only when you hire your first full-time W-2 style employee. (Contractors do not need this).

8. **[ ] TTA Registration:** File your Technology Transfer Agreement with GIPC to enable future profit repatriation.

### 5. Key Questions for Your Lawyer (The "Litmus Test")

When you hire the firm, ensure they agree with this strategy by asking:

1. "Can you confirm that using Paystack's Split Payment API exempts me from the 'Enhanced PSP' license under Act 987?"

2. "What is the current GIPC processing time for a Technology Transfer Agreement, and what is the maximum royalty % you are seeing approved recently?"

3. "For the $200,000 capital requirement, can we use a combination of cash and imported equipment (e.g., tablets for drivers), and how do we value those goods?"

### 6. Immediate Next Step

**Draft your "Capital Plan":** Before you pay a lawyer, you need to know where the $200,000 (on paper) is coming from.

- Is it cash from an angel investor?
- Is it a personal loan you are wiring over?
- Is it the value of technology/IP you are "importing"? (Ask the lawyer if they can capitalize your IP value—this is advanced but possible).

## Meeting Transcript

### Capital Requirements & Foreign Investment

**Lawyer:** ...areas. Basically, that's it.

**Ryan:** Fantastic.

**Lawyer:** Yeah. Right? Yeah. So, like you rightly said, foreigners coming to do business in here usually would be required to cover $500,000 USD. And if you have a Ghanaian partner, then you do $200,000 USD and your Ghanaian partner must have 10% of the total equity.

**Ryan:** Okay?

**Lawyer:** Yes. However, if the project is classed as—if you are classed as a Payment Service Provider (PSP)—then the requirement of the Ghanaian equity will then move up to 30%, along with other minimum capital requirements that the BoG (Bank of Ghana) sets for this class of industry players.

So the money is not strictly cash. If you have capital goods, that's acceptable. If you have a car for the company, you can value it, and then you can make that count. Of course, there are exceptions. If the company is doing solely export trading or manufacturing, that's exempt. Portfolio investment, that's exempt. Or if the foreign person is married to a Ghanaian and the marriage has lasted for five years, also exempt. That's basically it.

Then of course, there's a process you need to go through. If you're complying with these requirements, you need to register with the GIPC (Ghana Investment Promotion Centre) and they also have registration fees for that. So you pay the registration fee and then you need to establish that you brought the equity in. So usually in practice, you'd open bank accounts in Ghana, typically a Forex account and then a local account, and then you would wire the funds into Ghana.

When you add the funds to Ghana, you're supposed to liquidate it into Cedis. Yeah. And then your bank—and the BoG—is supposed to confirm that the money has arrived. But in practice, the way this works is that your bank will do that job. But of course you should follow up. So your bank should confirm to the BoG, and then the BoG releases a letter and says, "Yes, we confirm that Ryan has brought in this amount of equity into Ghana."

In practice, it's also recommended that your foreign bankers would put in the narration that the funds are equity. Yeah, because we've had instances where there was a bit of friction between the client and the BoG because that narration was not spelt out.

---

## Business Structure: US Entity vs Personal Registration

**Ryan:** Would I be registering this... So I already have a US business that's basically just like a holding business for software services. Would I be registering with the GIPC through my existing US business? Or would I be registering personally with the GIPC and effectively setting up an entirely separate business? Does the Ghanaian government care about the relationship to the US business, or are they just interested in the relationship to me personally?

**Lawyer:** Okay, that's a good question. I'll answer that and if my partner wants to chime in, that's fine. So it depends. If you come to Ghana and you say, "I the individual, I am the shareholder," then the Ghana government just wants to deal with you. But perhaps, if from a structuring standpoint, you want the US business to be the shareholder in Ghana so that it will be considered as a subsidiary, then the compliance requirements will be on the US shareholder or the US parent.

**Ryan:** Is there an advantage to doing it one way or the other when it comes to what I need to do in compliance with the Ghanaian government?

**Lawyer:** From a compliance standpoint, my opinion is that there's not, strictly speaking, an advantage of one over the other. It really will be according to how you want to structure the business. There is no clear advantage, because at the end of the day, even though you are the individual shareholder, once you incorporate a company, the company is then quite separate and will be treated the same as any other company. So there's not really much of a difference whether it's a corporate shareholder or a natural person shareholder.

---

## Payment Service Provider Classification

**Ryan:** That makes sense. When it comes to the classification...

**Lawyer:** Yeah.

**Ryan:** If my system never legally holds funds and it acts effectively as like a split payment API that passes through those transactions from the purchaser to the water truck driver, or the water truck driver to the depot—does that keep me in the category of a Technical Service Provider? How do I avoid effectively, accidentally or incorrectly getting classified? I definitely would like to avoid the 30% equity if possible. And so I want to make sure that I set myself up correctly now to be at that 10% as opposed to 30%.

**Lawyer:** Okay. So to get you correctly in this scenario: The service is restricted to providing the API services, isn't it? Then in that case, you're not bound [by the PSP rules] because you'll be seen as providing the technology. And so if you're licensing the technology to somebody, then that compliance requirement does not catch you.

---

## Partnership with Ghana Water Company

**Ryan:** And is there one thing that's potentially unique? I'm not sure exactly how this will happen yet, but a part of what it looks like will be a part of the business operation...

**Lawyer:** Yeah.

**Ryan:** ...is there's obviously a complicated relationship between the private depots and Ghana Water Company. Ghana Water Company, though—obviously right now they've shut down a lot of the hydrants—Ghana Water is needing data from the depots to effectively bring them back online, but with reduced non-water revenue. They effectively need to know which depots are stealing from us and which depots are paying, and my technology can provide them with that data.

And so, there's like the technology component, but then there's also very likely some type of partnership with Ghana Water. Obviously, I'm still figuring out whether or not that's exactly the way that I'm going to start and whether or not they're even interested in that pathway. But if I end up effectively having a relationship with Ghana Water, is there some element of that partnership that actually would change my business classification? Or does it not matter if I'm partnering with a utility or not? Is there any way to have a partnership change the type of classification of business that I need?

**Lawyer:** It really will depend on the nature and extent of that partnership. But in principle, I would say no. If you're having that partnership and you're not acting as a Payment Service Provider, then no. As long as the nature of the relationship does not make you a Payment Service Provider, in principle, you shouldn't be required to comply with obligations that are reserved for Payment Service Providers or other regulated entities.

---

## Technology Transfer Agreements (TTA)

**Ryan:** Okay. And then if I'm operating 100% as a foreign-owned software company, then I know that there's something related to Technology Transfer Agreements (TTA). But I'm not sure—from what I've read online, it sounds like that's something that I need to be working on pretty quickly, but I don't fully understand exactly what it is or how it relates to me.

**Lawyer:** Yeah. So the first port of call is that to be able to lawfully render the, you know, technology service, it should be a service that is not available in Ghana. That's number one.

**Ryan:** Okay?

**Lawyer:** And, yeah, number two. It should have a service duration of 18 months minimum.

**Ryan:** It has to already be operating for 18 months?

**Lawyer:** No. The agreement providing the technology service should be for a period of at least 18 months.

**Ryan:** Okay.

**Lawyer:** Yeah, I think the maximum is 10 years, I can confirm that. But the minimum is 18 months. So once you tick these boxes—you can't find the service anywhere in Ghana, it's going to be for at least 18 months and maximum of 10 years—then that qualifies under your Technology Transfer Agreement. And then in practice, and by law, it should be governed under Ghanaian law. Right. So once you tick these boxes, you're able to render the technology service, typically by the foreign entity to the Ghanaian company.

**Ryan:** That makes sense.

**Lawyer:** Does that answer your question?

**Ryan:** Yes, it does. And so the order of operations... Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

**Lawyer:** Let me come in. So I think he also wants to find out whether there will be a need to do Technology Transfer Agreement registration. Would he qualify for that registration under the Technology Transfer regulations? Or that's not what we are asking?

**Ryan:** I think I'll qualify because there is no other service.

**Lawyer:** Right, okay.

**Ryan:** There is no service right now that is exclusively a water marketplace service, and I definitely plan on operating for more than 18 months.

**Lawyer:** Right. Okay.

**Ryan:** Is there any reason not to apply for a Technology Transfer Agreement? That seems like it's just advantageous to pursue, but is there any reason not to pursue it?

**Lawyer:** No. Yeah. You can go ahead. No, there's actually no reason [not to]. So, basically, there's this dispute I'm doing for the managers of Labadi Beach Hotel. It was a South African company. The hotel SSNIT—which is a state-owned agency that is the largest shareholder of Labadi Beach Hotel—owed them an amount of, I believe, over $3 million.

Now, when we sued on behalf of the management company, the [Defendant's] argument is that the Technology Transfer Agreement was not registered. And based on that, it is fatal. And as a matter of fact, they are not going to make their payments. And the court of first instance actually upheld that argument. So that is to make the point that it is important that the registration is done.

---

## Alternative Structure: Trust Agreements

Also... [Partner] was talking about the incorporation dynamics, bringing a Ghanaian partner and all that. One aspect he didn't mention, just to the fact that usually what some people also do is that sometimes—and [Partner] knows about this—they get a Ghanaian person because they don't want to go under GIPC. What they do is they get a Ghanaian person to own the entity. However, at the back of that, there's a Trust Agreement that stipulates that "You are holding these shares/interest for my benefit." And this trust agreement is kept between the foreign entity and the Ghanaian person.

So technically, what that means is that although that person holds the shares, the beneficial owner of those shares is the foreign entity. It's a little bit complex. But it's one way you can also work around GIPC to avoid the minimum capital requirements and all that. And yes, there's a dialogue as to amendments of those provisions to exclude the minimum capital requirement. So, I mean, let's see how that progresses. There's an amendment by Parliament, let's say next month or whatever it is. Good. However, if that is going to be an impediment, then this is also an option you can explore by having someone in Ghana that... "Look, I can trust this guy to hold these shares for me." Let's do the incorporation. That's why I have everything at the back of that. We have an agreement, a very robust agreement that says that you're only holding the shares in trust for me. So basically, I don't know what [Partner] thinks about it.

**Partner:** Yeah. I agree with you. I think the only limitation will be that in certain industries, they've started to be strict on what they call fronting. So I think that is the only risk. But aside that, yes, like Gregory mentioned, you can do that and then execute these agreements. So you provide safeguards for both the nominee shareholder and then the company.

---

## Trust Structure & Legitimacy Concerns

**Ryan:** That's super helpful. And I'm guessing that there are companies or entities that effectively are set up to do exactly this, or set up to effectively be silent owners that then hold interest 100% of the shares? As you were talking about sort of cracking down on fronting... effectively, I think one of the things that I'm worried about is I'm hopeful to end up with some type of partnership with Ghana Water. That's like my long term goal.

**Lawyer:** Ok?

**Ryan:** And trust... obviously I am not Ghanaian, trust is a really important factor there. If I were set up with effectively a trust holding 100% of those shares, preventing that capital requirement... is that business structure effectively looked down upon? Does that run the risk of making me look like a less legitimate or less trustworthy operator if I was structured that way, as opposed to being fully declared as just a foreign owned entity that has the $200,000 minimum requirement and operates under the GIPC?

**Lawyer:** That's a good question. So, like Gregg said, we do... one of our clients is a Cryptocurrency company. So they have to do the $200k. So they have the $90k... but they decided because they wanted to do the $200k, they needed a 10% Ghanaian. And so that 10% Ghanaian didn't have the capital. And so what they did was to execute the Trust Agreement and allow him to hold that 10% so that they could meet the $200,000.

It wouldn't be a problem in the sense that, typically speaking in principle, you don't go behind the company to see who's doing what. So if you have that arrangement with the Ghanaian so you can make your life easy, and then you enter into the agreement with Ghana Water, you wouldn't necessarily be deemed to be a troublesome businessman unless there's an issue. So that's something you can also legitimately do. Assuming that meeting that financial threshold is a legitimate challenge, you can look at that option of getting a Ghanaian trusted partner who understands the industry.

**Ryan:** Yeah.

**Lawyer:** I don't know if Greg has anything to add. I think that's all. Yeah.

---

## Capital Usage & Integrity Capital

**Ryan:** I don't... I'm not too worried about getting the $200,000. I don't necessarily personally have it, but I have enough access to where I think I could probably end up getting the money that I need for that pretty easily.

**Lawyer:** Ok?

**Ryan:** I obviously would rather... Actually, here's a different question. That money doesn't have to be frozen in the account? That money can then be used for the operating expenses of the business? So, in essence, if I move $200,000 into an account...

**Lawyer:** Exactly.

**Ryan:** ...and I have a Ghanaian partner at 10%, so that's my rate, not the $500,000. If as soon as I put that money in, if I then start spending that money down on operational costs—is there a floor that you're supposed to keep that account at? Are you supposed to keep it at an average of a certain amount? What effectively prevents me from just moving $200,000 into that account, but then pretty quickly spending that money down and now effectively no longer using the account? What are the ongoing requirements of that account once it's opened?

**Lawyer:** Ok, so as a starting point: You can consume that money that you've brought in and use... excuse that... "use" is not a good word. [You can utilize the capital] for running your operations. You need money to run your operations. The only thing we need you to take note of is that certain license requirements from the Bank of Ghana, assuming you are classed to be in that category, some of them will require you to pay what they call the Integrity Capital, which they don't want you to touch.

**Ryan:** Okay?

**Lawyer:** Yeah. So outside of these restrictions, yes. You can go ahead and then use the money that was brought in as capital.

**Ryan:** And what is the amount for that? The Integrity Capital?

**Lawyer:** Yeah. We're going to send you an email.

**Ryan:** Okay.

**Lawyer:** Because the PSP (Payment Service Provider) license itself has certain nuances. We're going to look at what you discussed with us. We're going to consider your business carefully and see which of them will be more aligned to you and which Integrity Capital you must abide by. Assuming you are classed as a Payment Service Provider and not solely licensing a technology to other third parties.

---

## Registration Process & Order of Operations

**Ryan:** So the order of events... assuming I would rather not give up 100%. Even if there is like a trust agreement, just because enforcing that can be time consuming and challenging if something were to go wrong...

**Lawyer:** I can imagine.

**Ryan:** But so if I were to pursue the route of a foreign operated company with a 10% Ghanaian partner. Then step one would be find that partner. Then step two would be to register with the GIPC. Or is there anything else I need to do before registering with the GIPC?

**Lawyer:** So I would say yes. Aside from the GIPC, you're going to run this like a company. You're going to have employees. So we are going to advise you to register with SSNIT. SSNIT is the body in charge of Social Security.

**Ryan:** Ok?

**Lawyer:** So you're going to register your employees with SSNIT. You're going to also have to register with the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) because you'll be paying income tax on behalf of your employees. And because of the special nature of your business... if necessary, depending on the extent of your activity, you may have to look at the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency). It's not mandatory, but it depends on exactly what the spectrum of your business activities are. So aside from GIPC, these are the other options you should be looking at.

---

## Staffing Model & Independent Contractors

**Ryan:** Is there...? One of the benefits from being a software company is the water truck drivers, the depot owners won't be working for me. They'll just be customers, actually, of the software. And so from an asset perspective, I'm actually very capital light. Like, I won't own the water trucks, I won't own the depots. Right? Like, I just own the technology. And from an employee standpoint, the staffing requirements are actually incredibly low because it is really just the technology that then supports all of this from happening. So I plan on having like an operational manager on the ground. I plan on having some effectively like customer success people on the ground that can help triage and provide support, but it won't be like a labor intensive industry or business.

**Lawyer:** Ok?

**Ryan:** I don't know if that changes when I need to make that registration or not. Right now, for example, the person that I have on the ground is being contracted through a third party contract service and that works really, really well. So she actually doesn't work for me. Right? She routes through a third party contracting service. I do business with that third party contracting service. So in terms of initial cost and complexity, is it better to still go ahead and register with SSNIT—the organization around Social Security—or is it better to wait on that?

**Lawyer:** From the model you've described, I would say it's better to wait on that because it's a model that... even if from the way you describe it, looks more like an independent contractor kind of thing. And he doesn't even come from you. It comes from a third party. So then, no, you wouldn't require to do the income tax and all of that, you may just be required to register with the Ghana Revenue Authority, which doesn't immediately attract liability. The only reason why you are doing that is that in case you move from the losses, you break even and then you make profits, then you can conveniently pay your taxes because you already registered with them.

---

## Business Model Clarification

**Ryan:** Okay? Yeah. Exactly.

**Lawyer:** So just to be sure that I understand your business model, I'm trying to picture it like an Uber app, right? So I'm on the demand side of the water. I go to the Uber app, and then I see where the trucks are available, and then I can order. Is that how it works?

**Ryan:** Yeah. If you're a small business owner, or if you're at your house and either your tap isn't flowing or you just already operate on tanks and your water's low, then you can load up the app and you can simply place an order that you need water. And some people will already have like a dedicated driver. A lot of people obviously have drivers that they know. And so if you're already connected to a driver, then that will go straight into that driver's queue and they'll bring you water. Or if you're not already connected to a driver, it'll go into a marketplace. And just like Uber, how drivers can pick up a ride, there will be water orders that water truck drivers can pick up.

**Lawyer:** Yeah.

**Ryan:** That can either be scheduled or needed right away. And then for the drivers, the app will optimize routes, it'll help cut down fuel cost, and it will let them know which depots at any given point in time have water so that they're not driving around the entire city trying to figure out where they can get water. And so the drivers are able to quickly get water and optimize their routes, save fuel, get more routes in on a day, and the purchaser is able to know when they're getting their water and have transparency around pricing.

**Lawyer:** Ok?

**Ryan:** Because it's happening through the app instead of it all just sort of... A lot of the folks that I've talked to just in the last couple of months, they'll think that they're paying a certain amount, and then the driver will show up and say, "I had to spend more on gas or it took me longer to find water, so the amount that you have to pay is double." And that's really tough for the purchasers who don't have reliable, consistent pricing.

---

## Payment Integration with Paystack

**Lawyer:** That's pretty interesting. Then there is some possibility that... there is some possibility that you may not necessarily be a Payment Service Provider, but we'll have to partner with a Payment Service Provider that will then provide the integration to allow for payment flows.

**Ryan:** Exactly.

**Lawyer:** Ok. Thanks for that. Thanks for that context.

**Ryan:** I will probably use a tool called Paystack. I don't know if you're familiar with that, but Paystack...

**Lawyer:** Yes, it's very popular in Ghana.

**Ryan:** Okay. Perfect. Yeah. And so Paystack will effectively be... My system will connect with Paystack and the order happens on my app. My app then sends that order to Paystack to process the payment, and I get confirmation that that's gone through. And then Paystack does the holding and pays out the water truck driver through the same system. So it will feel like it's all just going through my app, but on the back end, the actual payment is happening with Paystack.

**Lawyer:** All right. Ok. Ok. That makes a lot of sense. You're just a tech provider. Paystack is the PSP. Makes sense.

---

## Pricing & Timeline

**Ryan:** I think those were the biggest questions that I had out of the gate. Do you all have like a fixed package in terms of like a "help a foreign business get set up" package, or do you just operate on an hourly basis? This will probably... My hope is to be operational towards the last quarter of 2026. So within the next 10 to 12 months.

**Lawyer:** Okay?

**Ryan:** And so, you know, there will be multiple steps sort of along the way. So from a payment system structure, what's the easiest way? How do you typically operate with these types of situations?

**Lawyer:** Yeah. So the good thing is that we offer a lot of flexibility that is tailored for the client that has come to see us. So we can send you a certain brochure that is on "Doing Business in Ghana" that will sort of highlight the things that you need to be aware of when you are doing business. We can accompany that with specific fee quotes that will take you on a step by step journey of what your financial implications will be if you're going to pay us for whatever service you need to cross this business hurdle. So it's very flexible. When necessary, we can do the hourly, but we are used to doing the fixed fee service. Unless it's reasonable to use the hourly. But yes, as a principle, fixed fee.

**Ryan:** That makes sense. Well, yeah, if you're able to email over what the fix fee is and what your additional, like, hourly rates are and just help me sort of put a picture together of what you all charge, an estimate of how long a typical setup like this might take, that would be super helpful. And then are there any additional questions that you have for me or about the business?

**Lawyer:** Yeah. Ok, you already answered the first one when you said the typical timeline will be Q4 of next year. So that has been answered. My other question will be in how many countries are you active now or which country are you active now? Is it Argentina?

**Ryan:** No, this is a brand new startup. So Ghana will be the pilot. Accra will be the pilot city and Ghana the pilot country. I plan to expand to other countries. But my hope is to launch in Accra, spend two years building out in Accra, and then expand that to some of the nearby countries.

**Lawyer:** Ok. I think Greg will agree with me if I say you came to the right destination because Ghana ticks the boxes of a lot of metrics.

**Ryan:** Yeah.

**Lawyer:** So, yeah, that's pretty much the question I had. I don't know about Greg.

**Ryan:** Fantastic.

## Market Validation & Water Crisis Context

**Partner (Greg):** You have a question? Can you hear me?

**Ryan:** Yes.

**Partner (Greg):** Yes, I can hear you. Yes. Just to comment, Ryan, for the project... because listening... currently even in my house, I have water issues. And when you call the drivers to bring water, it takes days to actually get it. Currently there's demand for it in Ghana because we are having water issues. And coupled with the fact that Galamsey [illegal mining] is also taking over waters and a whole lot of things. So, water shortage... you don't have to be a prophet to actually see that, look, it's going to happen.

So it's something that is really good, and I see it becoming big here because really and truly, there's nothing like that as it stands. So what I do in my house is that when the Polytanks are getting [low]... and they have two Polytanks... so when it gets to the second one gets to half tank, I start ordering water because I know it will take a day or two before I get it. So I think it's a really good thing and it's something that would help us a lot. Yes.

**Ryan:** That's super helpful, and I appreciate you sharing that story. And I've gotten to talk to a lot of people over the last few months that have had similar stories. I was talking with a woman a week or two ago who was like, five years ago her water would get cut off a few days a week. And she's out in the Tema area, and she said that she hasn't had water turned on in almost a month now. It keeps getting worse and worse. And then, yeah, the Galamsey causing more pollution, which then causes the treatment plants to have to work harder and they're having to do more maintenance. It seems like an opportunity where if you put some technology in place that can help reduce some of the friction and help make this a little bit easier for everyone, it'll take some pressure off the system in a way that'll be hopefully pretty helpful.

**Partner (Greg):** Absolutely. And it's going to be something that's going to be... it's going to be really helpful too because even... clearly people don't even purchase even bottled water, treated water. People are skeptical about purchasing water that is treated here in Ghana. They are more comfortable dealing with water outside because of Galamsey activities and the fact that, look, aspects... that now there are accessing chemicals [arsenic/mercury] in our water that isn't good for consumption and all that. So I think this is really good. And it's going to be super helpful to all of us. So we pray you come in early and bring us work as well.

**Ryan:** Yeah, absolutely. No, I appreciate you sharing that. Well, thank you both so much for your time. I appreciate you all making yourself available. And I'll look for that email from you, and hopefully we get a chance to work together.

**Lawyer:** Yes, we look forward to that as well.

**Ryan:** Okay. Wonderful. All right. You all have a wonderful rest of your day. Thank you so much.

**Lawyer:** All right. Thank you. You take care.

## Key Takeaways

### Capital Requirements
- **Foreign-only ownership:** $500,000 USD minimum capital
- **With 10% Ghanaian partner:** $200,000 USD minimum capital
- **Payment Service Provider (PSP):** 30% Ghanaian equity requirement + additional capital requirements
- **Capital can include:** Cash, capital goods, vehicles (valued and counted toward requirement)

### Business Classification
- **Tech Service Provider:** Avoid PSP classification by not holding funds
- **Using Paystack:** Keeps WaterOS as tech provider, Paystack handles payments
- **Partnership with Ghana Water:** Won't change classification as long as not acting as PSP

### Technology Transfer Agreement (TTA)
- **Requirements:**
  - Service not available in Ghana
  - Minimum 18 months duration
  - Maximum 10 years duration
  - Must be governed under Ghanaian law
- **Critical:** TTA registration is mandatory and failure to register can be fatal to enforcing agreements

### Registration Process
1. Find 10% Ghanaian partner (if going that route)
2. Register with GIPC (Ghana Investment Promotion Centre)
3. Open Forex and local bank accounts
4. Wire funds to Ghana with "equity" narration
5. Bank confirms funds to BoG (Bank of Ghana)
6. BoG releases confirmation letter
7. Register with Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA)
8. Register with SSNIT (Social Security) - *Only when hiring direct employees*
9. Consider EPA registration if needed

### Alternative Structure
- **Trust Agreement:** Ghanaian nominee shareholder holds shares in trust for foreign owner
- **Risk:** "Fronting" crackdown in certain industries
- **Legitimacy:** Generally acceptable, won't harm Ghana Water partnership prospects

### Capital Usage
- **Can be used:** For operational expenses after confirmation
- **Integrity Capital:** May need to maintain untouchable capital if classified as PSP (amount TBD)

### Staffing Model
- Independent contractors through third-party service: No immediate SSNIT/income tax registration required
- Only need GRA registration for future tax compliance when profitable

### Timeline
- Target: Q4 2026 operational launch
- Legal setup: Multiple steps over 10-12 months
