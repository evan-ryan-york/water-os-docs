# GPT: Source to Tap

## How Urban Water Gets from Source to Homes in Developing Cities

### Water Sources and Treatment

Virtually all large cities in low- and middle-income countries rely on centralized water sources that are treated before distribution. Common sources include rivers, lakes, or reservoirs (stored rainwater) and groundwater via well fields or boreholes. These raw waters are conveyed to water treatment plants, where processes like sedimentation, filtration, and chlorination ensure the water meets safety standards. For example, a city might draw from a river upstream, treat it at a plant, then pump it into the distribution system. Many cities also use service reservoirs or water towers to store treated water and maintain pressure. These elevated tanks allow gravity to help push water through pipes, and additional pumps are used if gravity flow is insufficient. In practice, each city often has several treatment plants and storage tanks, supplying different zones. The result is that most urban residents are, in theory, served by a network carrying potable water from a central source to their area.

However, the reality is that access to this piped water is far from universal. In sub-Saharan Africa, only about 15% of households have a direct piped water connection on their premises, and even in cities many people rely on other delivery modes. Still, the infrastructure backbone – centralized intake, treatment, trunk pipelines, and storage – exists in virtually all major cities, even if capacity is strained. Smaller towns may sometimes skip full treatment (using chlorination only, especially for groundwater), but generally safe water at the source is the starting point. The challenge is getting that water to every home reliably.

### Distribution Networks and Pipe Infrastructure

From the treatment facility or reservoir, large transmission mains (high-capacity pipes) carry water toward the city. These trunk lines often run underground along main roads or rights-of-way. As they reach population centers, they branch into a distribution network of smaller pipes that spread through neighborhoods like a web. The distribution network is typically a mix of pipe sizes: primary mains (e.g. 300–600 mm diameter) feed secondary pipes, which in turn feed small tertiary pipes that go down individual streets. The layout can be grid-like or branched ("tree" network), usually following the road plan. Valves are installed at intervals so sections can be isolated for repairs or for rationing.

Pipe materials vary widely. Older systems (mid-20th century) commonly used cast iron or even asbestos-cement pipes, and some very old networks had concrete or fired-clay conduits. Today, most new distribution pipes are plastic like PVC or HDPE for smaller diameters, due to their low cost and corrosion resistance. Large mains may use ductile iron or steel for strength. In summary, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), ductile/cast iron, steel, and copper (for small lines) are all common, while older pipes may be asbestos-cement, concrete, or even clay in antiquated sections. Modern plastic pipes now dominate new installations in developing cities because they are cheaper and easier to lay than metal.

#### Pipe Placement and Installation

Water mains are normally buried below ground for protection. In temperate countries they must be below frost line, but in tropical developing cities the depth is more about preventing damage from traffic and tampering. A typical burial depth is on the order of 0.5–1 meter. For instance, Indian guidelines note that water mains are generally laid about 0.9 m underground. This provides a buffer against vehicles and surface loads and reduces exposure to heat. Major transmission pipelines may be buried even deeper or encased in concrete under roads.

Above-ground water pipes are relatively rare in urban networks, but they do exist in special cases. Sometimes in rocky terrains or to cross rivers/valleys, pipes may run exposed or on stilts. In some dense informal settlements, utilities have experimented with raising pipes overhead to prevent illegal tapping. For example, in Kibera (a large slum in Nairobi), an NGO built an aerial pipeline system – suspending six-inch water mains 20 feet above ground – to supply water kiosks without interference from cartels or contaminating drains. Generally, though, distribution pipes are buried beneath streets or sidewalks. House connections and smaller pipes in slums might be shallow or even run along the surface in drainage ditches ("spaghetti" lines), but primary distribution mains stay underground for security.

#### Network Mapping and Infrastructure Challenges

A major issue in many developing cities is that the exact layout and condition of these pipes isn't well documented. It's estimated that 40–60% of the pipe network in many emerging cities is unmapped, because extensions were built over decades without proper records. Utilities often inherit old pipelines from colonial times or hastily built informal lines. This lack of maps means utilities sometimes literally don't know where all the pipes are or which ones are shut off. Old pipes (many 30–50+ years in service) are prone to leaks and bursts. Maintenance is reactive – crews fix visible leaks – but countless hidden leaks go undetected. In fact, non-revenue water (NRW) losses (from leaks, theft, etc.) are extremely high: most water utilities in developing countries have NRW exceeding 50%. That means up to half the treated water vanishes before reaching consumers, highlighting the aging, leaky state of infrastructure. Reducing these losses by upgrading pipes and better monitoring is a key goal of projects like "Water OS."

### Service Delivery: Connections, Standpipes, and Water Trucks

Water from the distribution network reaches end users through a variety of delivery points. The ideal is a piped connection to every home – typically a 15–25 mm (1/2″ to 1″) service line branching from the street main into the property. In a house connection, a small saddle or tapping is made on the main, a service pipe leads to the customer's property, and a water meter (and shutoff valve) is installed at the property boundary. Inside, the house may have plumbing to taps, or in poorer homes just a single tap in the yard. This direct connection allows water on demand – when the network is pressurized – at utility tariffs.

Unfortunately, in low-income urban areas few households have their own connection. Many must rely on shared or public water points. A common solution is the standpipe or water kiosk, which is essentially a communal tap connected to the network. These standpipes may be simple spigots on a post or more elaborate kiosks with an attendant. Residents bring jerrycans and buckets to collect water, often paying per container. In cities across Africa and Asia, water kiosks are critical for serving slums and peri-urban zones that lack home pipes. Indeed, urban water consumers in Africa "rely heavily on shared connections and public standposts" – reflecting how common this arrangement is. It's not unusual for one standpipe to serve dozens of families. Some kiosks are operated by the utility (coin-operated or prepaid systems are emerging), while others are run by private vendors who buy water in bulk from the utility and resell it.

#### Alternative Water Delivery Systems

Beyond standpipes, some households get water via water vendors and tanker trucks. Where pipe networks do not reach or supply is very intermittent, a private market often thrives. Small-scale vendors might carry water in jerrycans on carts or motorcycles, selling it door-to-door. In many cities (like Dar es Salaam, Pune, Lusaka), tanker trucks deliver water to richer homes or businesses that can pay. These trucks typically fill up from a utility hydrant or a borehole filling station, then drive the water to neighborhoods and pump it into customers' storage tanks. Truck water is expensive – often 10 to 20 times the utility's piped water price – but in areas with no reliable pipes, it's essential. For instance, Dar es Salaam has entire suburbs dependent on water delivered by private tankers because only ~8% of households have a formal piped supply to their dwelling. In Accra, Ghana, many people buy water in 20-L sachets or from roaming vendors because their house isn't connected or pressure is too low. These alternatives fill the gap but at a high economic cost and sometimes dubious quality control.

#### Summary of Water Delivery Models

The pattern in many developing cities is a mix of delivery modes:

- **A minority have in-house or yard pipe connections** (often wealthier or in planned neighborhoods)
- **Many use communal taps or kiosks tied into the network**, walking and queueing to get water
- **Others rely on mobile water delivery** (trucks, hand carts) or small private networks

The presence of multiple systems means even where a city's pipes exist, not everyone is directly reached. Expanding house connections is a long-term goal, but interim solutions like kiosks are critical for equity. It's also worth noting that in some cities, community-managed mini-networks operate in slums: local entrepreneurs or NGOs might tap the main and run plastic hoses ("spaghetti pipes") through alleys to sell water. These setups are often unofficial, which utilities are now trying to formalize for safety and revenue reasons.

### Network Operation: Pressure and Intermittent Supply

A key aspect of water distribution is that the network must be kept under pressure to deliver water to taps. Pumps at treatment plants or booster stations push water through the mains, or gravity does the work if water is stored uphill. Ideally, a continuous positive pressure is maintained 24/7, ensuring water is available whenever a tap is opened. In practice, however, many developing city networks supply water intermittently rather than continuously.

#### The Reality of Intermittent Water Supply (IWS)

Intermittent Water Supply (IWS) is extremely common "in the vast majority of cities in low-income countries." This means areas get water only at certain times – perhaps a few hours per day or only on certain days of the week. For example, an urban district might be scheduled to receive water from 6–10am and 6–10pm daily, or some neighborhoods only on alternate days. Utilities impose such rotations because there isn't enough water or pumping capacity to serve the whole city at once. Under-sizing of pipes, limited supply from source, or power/equipment constraints all contribute to this practice. In one Indian city (Hubli-Dharwad), before upgrades they supplied most zones only once every 5 days for a few hours! While that is an extreme, even "24-hour" systems in many African/Asian cities actually deliver perhaps 12–18 hours of water per day on average.

#### Implications of Intermittent Supply

Intermittency has several implications:

1. **Household Storage**: Households adapt by storing water during supply hours. Urban dwellings often have rooftop tanks, drums, or jerrycans to save water for when the taps run dry. While this provides a buffer, it also means water sits stagnant and can become contaminated in home storage.

2. **Network Management**: Utilities manage flows with valves – effectively rationing water by opening/closing district valves on a schedule. Operators may do this manually or with some automation, but it's a complex task to ensure each area gets its turn and that reservoir levels stay balanced.

3. **Water Quality Risks**: Intermittent supply affects water quality and pipe integrity. When a pipe is pressurized with water, any leaks push water out. But when supply is off, pressure drops to zero and empty pipes can suck in surrounding contaminants (dirty groundwater, sewage from leaking sewer lines, etc.) through cracks. Research confirms that providing water intermittently "can compromise water quality in the distribution system."

4. **Infrastructure Stress**: The on-off cycles cause stress on the infrastructure. Repeated pressurization can lead to pipe bursts when aging pipes are suddenly re-pressurized each day. It also renders leak detection harder, since leaks only manifest when the water is on.

Continuous supply with steady pressure is the gold standard, as it prevents contamination and provides better service. Where pilot projects have converted areas to 24/7 supply, results showed fewer illnesses (e.g. lower typhoid and dysentery in one Indian city after going continuous). However, upgrading old networks to true continuous service requires massive investments – fixing leaks, increasing water production, and often adding storage and new pipes. Until then, intermittent service remains the norm across much of the developing world.

### Water Quality and Safety Issues

Delivering safe, potable water is as important as delivering enough water. In well-run systems, water leaving the treatment plant is chlorinated and microbiologically safe. The challenge is maintaining that quality through miles of pipe and various handling points. In developing city networks, water quality often degrades by the time it reaches households.

#### Contamination Mechanisms

1. **Contamination via leaks and low pressure**: When pipes leak and especially under intermittent supply, dirty water can enter. During off periods, pipes may even lie empty in filthy soil or wastewater. Then when flow resumes, that entrained contamination is swept along.

2. **Loss of chlorine residual**: Chlorine added at the plant provides ongoing disinfection in the network, but over long distances or long travel times the chlorine can dissipate.

3. **Cross-connections**: Illegal or improper connections can cause unsafe water to mix with the clean supply.

4. **Quality at communal points**: Water drawn from a utility standpipe or tanker might be clean at filling, but then it's carried and stored in jerrycans that are not always sanitary.

#### Building Trust in Water Quality

To build trust, some cities have begun publishing water quality data and installing real-time monitors. Technologies under the "Water OS" vision include IoT sensors at points in the network and household test kits feeding data back, to ensure any contamination is quickly detected. In the long run, achieving 24/7 pressurized supply and fully rehabilitated pipes (no leaks) is the surest way to guarantee safe tap water.

### Expansion and Maintenance of the Network

Decisions about where to lay new pipes or replace old ones are generally made by the city's water utility. These utilities create master plans forecasting population growth and water demand, and they prioritize projects to extend service to unserved areas. In practice, expansion often depends on funding availability – frequently from government budgets or international donors.

When it comes to replacing or repairing old pipes, most utilities face a tough balancing act. Old pipe replacement is capital-intensive, so it's often deferred. Maintenance crews typically patch leaks as they appear rather than swapping out entire lines. The lack of accurate maps complicates proactive maintenance – you can't replace what you don't know you have.

## Conclusion

The journey of water from source to home in developing urban areas is an intricate chain. It starts at a central intake and treatment, flows through a vast (often aging) pipe network, and ends at various delivery points – some at the household, many at communal points – with water quality risks along the way. The patterns across cities are similar: limited coverage of house connections, heavy reliance on communal supply, intermittent flow, and significant water loss.

By deeply understanding the physical infrastructure – treatment plants, underground mains, pump stations, valves, meters, and more – we can appreciate both the achievements and shortcomings of current water delivery in developing cities. Strengthening it (both the pipes and the digital "operating system" managing them) will be key to ensuring that one day every household can turn on a tap and trust that clean water will be there, anytime.
