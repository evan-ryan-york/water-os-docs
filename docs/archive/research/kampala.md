# Strategic Pilot City Assessment: Evaluating Kampala, Uganda for Water OS

## Executive Summary

Kampala, Uganda, presents a highly compelling, albeit not risk-free, opportunity for the Water OS pilot. The city is characterized by a significant and financially damaging Non-Revenue Water (NRW) problem, which is a publicly acknowledged strategic priority for its utility, creating an ideal problem-solution fit. This is coupled with a uniquely capable and forward-thinking institutional partner, the National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC), and a mature digital payments infrastructure that directly enables the proposed performance-based revenue model. While systemic risks such as corruption and founder security require careful management, the overall institutional readiness, intense funder interest, and robust local ecosystem make Kampala a strong candidate for a successful, revenue-generating pilot and a strategic foundation for the long-term Water OS vision in Africa.

## Problem Severity & Urgency (Weight: 20%)

### 1.1 Specifics of NRW Crisis
**Score: 5 (Critical, >40%)**
The Non-Revenue Water (NRW) situation in Kampala represents a critical and officially acknowledged crisis for the national utility, the National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC). As of 2024, the corporation's overall NRW rate was 34%.1 The problem is even more acute in the Kampala Water service area, the proposed pilot location, where the NRW rate stands at approximately 41%.3 This level of water loss is not merely an operational inefficiency; it constitutes a severe financial hemorrhage. A 2025 report quantified the annual financial loss from this unbilled water at UGX 54.9 billion, equivalent to approximately USD $14.8 million.4 This staggering figure exceeds the annual budgets of some government departments and represents a significant opportunity cost in terms of funds that could be reinvested into network expansion or service improvements.4

The underlying causes of this high NRW rate are well-understood and documented by the utility itself. They fall into the two primary categories that the Water OS model is designed to address: physical losses and commercial losses. Physical losses stem from an aging pipeline network, particularly in older urban centers like Kampala, which is prone to frequent leaks and bursts.4 Commercial losses are attributed to unauthorized consumption through illegal connections, meter tampering, and technical inaccuracies from faulty or outdated meters.3

Crucially, NRW reduction is not a peripheral issue for NWSC's leadership; it is a central strategic priority. The utility's corporate plans explicitly include targets for lowering the NRW rate, with a stated goal of reducing the national average from 34% to 30% by 2029.1 The Managing Director, [Dr. Silver Mugisha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/silver-mugisha-81678138), has publicly acknowledged the scale of the problem and its impact on financial stability and credibility with development partners.4 This high-level acknowledgment creates an ideal "problem-solution fit." Water OS would not be entering a market that needs to be educated about the problem, but rather one that is actively and urgently seeking effective solutions to a well-understood and financially painful reality.

### 1.2 Household Impact & Willingness to Pay
**Score: 5 (Severe, chronic rationing, high vendor premiums)**
The impact of water network inefficiencies on Kampala's households is severe, creating a clear and quantifiable demand for improved service reliability. Water supply is not consistently available 24/7 across the metropolitan area. Chronic shortages and interruptions are common, particularly in rapidly growing informal settlements and areas on higher ground.6 Reports from residents in some areas of the greater Kampala region indicate going without piped water for months at a time, forcing them to seek alternative, often unsafe, sources.8

This service gap has spawned a thriving informal water market where residents are forced to pay significant premiums. Private water vendors, who often manage public water points or sell from household connections, charge unregulated market prices that can be between five and twenty times the official NWSC tariff.9 For example, residents may pay UGX 500 to 1,000 for a 20-liter jerrycan from a vendor, whereas the subsidized tariff at an NWSC prepaid standpipe can be as low as UGX 25 to 100 for the same volume.10 This price disparity is a powerful, real-time validation of the monetary value of reliable water access and demonstrates a very high "willingness to pay" among the population.

This dynamic provides a powerful foundation for the Water OS revenue model. The "verified monetary value of the recovered water" is not a theoretical concept based on saved production costs for the utility. It is a tangible economic reality demonstrated daily in the city's informal markets. The value unlocked by fixing a leak and restoring reliable supply to a neighborhood can be measured by the dramatic reduction in household expenditure on overpriced, vended water. This allows the 10-15% revenue share to be framed not as a cost to NWSC, but as capturing a small fraction of the immense economic value created for the community. NWSC is aware of this issue and, with its partners, is actively working to combat it by installing thousands of subsidized prepaid meters in informal settlements to provide water at the official, lower tariff.10 This initiative shows a commitment to serving these communities, and the Water OS model can be positioned as a way to ensure these new meters are supplied with a reliable flow of water.

### 1.3 Public & Political Pressure
**Score: 5 (Intense pressure, top political priority)**
The challenge of providing adequate water and sanitation in Kampala has escalated to become a high-visibility political issue, creating intense pressure on both the government and NWSC leadership to deliver tangible improvements. This pressure is most clearly demonstrated by the government's active pursuit and public defense of large-scale international financing for water infrastructure projects.

In early 2025, the Minister of State for Finance, Henry Musasizi, appeared before a parliamentary committee to defend a proposal for an additional loan of €45 million (approximately UGX 171.5 billion) from the French Development Agency (AFD). He explicitly stated the funds were critical to resolving ongoing issues with water supply and sanitation in the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area, which have been strained by rapid urbanization and industrial growth.13 The minister highlighted that demand is projected to rise significantly, and that this investment is essential to serve the region's population, which is expected to reach 7.4 million by 2040.13

This high-level political engagement signals that water supply is a top priority. Government ministers and members of parliament are on the public record supporting these investments and urging NWSC to resolve the water crisis by specific timelines.13 This political context creates a powerful tailwind for a solution like Water OS. Large infrastructure projects, like the new Katosi water treatment plant, take years to complete and require massive capital outlays. While they increase overall production capacity, they do not solve the "last mile" problem of distribution network losses. The Water OS pilot offers a unique opportunity for a quick, measurable "political win." By identifying and facilitating the repair of high-impact leaks in specific "anomaly hotspots," the pilot can demonstrate tangible improvements in service delivery within months, not years. This provides politicians and utility leaders with a positive narrative of immediate, data-driven action while the larger, slower projects are ongoing. This makes the pilot a strategic communications asset for them, increasing their motivation to ensure its success.

## Institutional Readiness & Governance (Weight: 35%)

### 2.1 Government & Utility Agility
**Score: 4 (Agile & Innovative, "Smart City" focus)**
The institutional environment in Kampala is remarkably agile and forward-thinking, particularly for a public utility in the region. NWSC is widely regarded as one of the best-run water utilities in Africa.14 Since its reorganization in 1995, it has been mandated to operate on a "sound commercial and viable basis," which has fostered a culture of performance and efficiency.1 This is not a stagnant bureaucracy. Under the leadership of Managing Director [Dr. Eng. Silver Mugisha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/silver-mugisha-81678138), the corporation has publicly championed innovation, digital transformation, and the development of homegrown technical solutions.15

This commitment to innovation is not merely rhetorical. NWSC has invested in and deployed a range of modern technologies to enhance its operations. These include a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system for infrastructure monitoring, a Geographic Information System (GIS) for network mapping, and a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system to streamline customer interactions and complaint resolution.17 The utility has also developed a comprehensive suite of e-services, including online portals and mobile applications, to improve customer engagement.17 This existing technological foundation demonstrates an institutional capacity and willingness to adopt and integrate new digital tools.

This agility at the utility level is complemented by a broader vision at the city governance level. The Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) has a stated ambition to transform Kampala into a "Smart City".6 Kampala was selected as a lead city in the Africa Smart Towns Network (ASToN), a program that promotes the use of digital technology to improve service delivery.19 KCCA has already implemented initiatives in areas like automated revenue management and smart traffic control.19 This creates a powerful synergy. A partnership with Water OS aligns perfectly with both NWSC's internal drive to become a "SMART utility" and KCCA's external branding as a "Smart City." The pilot would serve as a tangible proof point for their own strategic narratives, providing a showcase project that applies innovative technology to solve a fundamental urban challenge. This alignment of strategic goals creates the potential for powerful internal champions who are invested in the pilot's success as a means of validating their own institutional vision.

### 2.2 Corruption & Entrenched Operators
**Score: 2 (High Risk, but with mitigating factors)**
Systemic corruption presents a significant and undeniable risk to operating in Uganda. The country performs poorly on global indices, with the 2024 Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) ranking it 140th out of 180 countries with a low score of 26 out of 100.21 Corruption is acknowledged domestically as a pervasive challenge that manifests in forms such as bribery, embezzlement, and nepotism, eroding public trust and hindering development.21 In the water sector specifically, studies have indicated that corruption can inflate the cost of connecting a household to the network by as much as 30% and that bribes related to contract awards can average 10% of the contract value.24 This environment could foster "water mafias" or entrenched contractors who profit from the status quo of emergency repairs and opaque procurement.

However, this high-level risk is partially mitigated by two important factors. First, Uganda's water sector has a documented history of proactively confronting integrity issues. In 2006, the Ministry of Water and Environment (MWE) established a multi-stakeholder Good Governance Sub-Sector Working Group (GGSSWG) and later commissioned a Water Integrity Study to better understand and address corruption risks.25 This indicates an institutional awareness of the problem and a willingness to implement reforms, distinguishing it from sectors where corruption may go unaddressed.

Second, and more powerfully, the Water OS business model is inherently resistant to common forms of corruption. The model's foundation on data transparency serves as a direct antidote to the opacity that allows corruption to thrive. The "See It" phase creates a transparent, shared view of the network's health through the digital twin. The "Understand It" phase uses objective, verifiable IoT sensor data to quantify losses, replacing subjective estimates. The "Fix It" phase ties financing directly to specific, high-ROI repairs, and revenue is calculated as a percentage of the verified water savings. Every step of this process is data-backed and auditable. This structure makes it difficult for a contractor to inflate an invoice for a ghost repair or for an official to divert funds, as the payment is tied to a measurable outcome. This can be framed as a key strategic advantage when engaging with NWSC and its international funders, offering them a partnership model with built-in accountability that directly addresses one of their biggest stated risks.

### 2.3 History of Partnering with Startups/Pilots
**Score: 4 (Open, documented pilots with private firms)**
While there is no specific, documented evidence of NWSC partnering with early-stage, venture-backed startups in the mold of a Silicon Valley company, there is overwhelming evidence of its deep and long-standing history of collaborating with a wide range of external, private-sector partners. This history demonstrates an institutional comfort and procedural readiness for engaging with non-state actors to solve core operational and strategic challenges.

NWSC has a track record of entering into service and management contracts with large, international firms. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, it had consecutive management contracts for billing and collection in Kampala with the German company H.P. Gauff Ingenieure and the French company OSUL (Ondeo Services Uganda Limited).7 This relationship with Gauff has continued for decades, with the firm recently being contracted for consulting services on the design and supervision of new infrastructure projects.27 NWSC also works with international construction firms like Sogea Satom of France on major capital projects.12

This openness extends to exploring new technologies with international peers. In February 2024, NWSC leadership met with Vitens, a Dutch water utility, to discuss cutting-edge solutions for combating NRW, including the potential for a smart metering pilot project in the Kampala service area.28 At the city level, KCCA has also implemented various pilot projects, including a Traffic Control Centre and a Non-Motorized Transport corridor, demonstrating a willingness to test new urban solutions.20

The operational DNA of NWSC clearly includes seeking and integrating external expertise. The utility possesses the legal, procurement, and project management frameworks necessary to engage with outside entities. Therefore, the challenge for Water OS is not to convince NWSC to consider a private partnership for the first time, but rather to demonstrate that its agile, performance-based model is a more effective and less risky approach for tackling NRW hotspots than a traditional, large-scale consulting or construction contract. Their history suggests they are very much open to having that conversation.

### 2.4 Existing Interest from Funders
**Score: 5 (High interest, multiple active water projects)**
Kampala's water and sanitation sector is a focal point for major international Development Finance Institutions (DFIs), resulting in a consistent and substantial flow of investment. This high level of funder interest creates a sophisticated and resource-rich ecosystem for a pilot project. The list of active funders is extensive and includes the World Bank, the African Development Bank (AfDB), the French Development Agency (AFD), the German Development Bank (KfW), the European Investment Bank (EIB), and the European Union (EU).1

The flagship initiative supported by this consortium is the Kampala Water Lake Victoria Water and Sanitation (KW-LVWATSAN) Project. This multi-phase, multi-hundred-million-Euro project is a comprehensive effort to secure Kampala's long-term water supply. It has funded major capital works, including the upgrade of the Ggaba water treatment plants and the construction of the new Katosi Water Treatment Plant, which has a capacity of 160,000 cubic meters per day.1 Recent financing tranches, such as a €45 million loan from AFD in 2025, are focused on the "last mile" challenge: expanding and rehabilitating the distribution network to ensure the water produced at these new plants can actually reach customers.12

This intense funder activity creates a uniquely favorable environment. These DFIs are not simply providing capital; they bring rigorous standards for monitoring, evaluation, and accountability. They value data-driven approaches, measurable impact, and financial transparency—the core tenets of the Water OS model. The "Water OS Recovery Fund" can be strategically positioned not as a competitor for this funding, but as a highly efficient, complementary "last mile" financing vehicle. While the large DFI loans are allocated to CAPEX-heavy infrastructure that takes years to build, the Recovery Fund can be used for rapid, high-ROI operational repairs that maximize the effectiveness of those larger investments. This creates a symbiotic relationship, allowing Water OS to pitch the fund directly to the local offices of the World Bank or AFD as a co-funding opportunity that enhances the performance of their existing portfolio.

## Technical & Financial Infrastructure (Weight: 25%)

### 3.1 Adoption of Digital Payment Systems
**Score: 5 (Ubiquitous, >60% penetration, trusted for utilities)**
Uganda possesses a mature, ubiquitous, and trusted digital payment infrastructure, primarily driven by mobile money, which is a critical enabler for the Water OS business model. The market is substantial and growing rapidly, with a total value of USD $133 billion in 2024 projected to reach USD $1.15 trillion by 2033.35 Cellular mobile connections were active for 76.2% of the population in early 2025, providing the foundational access for these services.36

Crucially, this is not a nascent technology that the utility needs to be convinced to adopt. NWSC has fully integrated mobile money as a primary method for customers to pay their water bills.37 This is offered alongside other digital options like mobile banking and electronic funds transfers, demonstrating a comprehensive digital payment strategy.38 The system is trusted and widely used by the customer base. This existing financial "plumbing" removes a massive operational barrier for Water OS.

The maturity of the ecosystem is further evidenced by the continuous innovation from providers. In 2025, MTN Uganda, a major telecom operator, reported handling 2.4 billion mobile money transactions worth UGX 89.3 trillion (approx. USD $24 billion) in just six months.39 The ecosystem is evolving beyond simple payments to include more sophisticated financial products, such as virtual prepaid cards in partnership with Mastercard and digital micro-lending services, all accessible via mobile wallets.35 This robust infrastructure directly de-risks both the revenue collection and the financing components of the Water OS model. Collecting the 10-15% revenue share can be streamlined through a digital collection agreement with NWSC. Furthermore, the "Water OS Recovery Fund" can disburse funds for repairs to local crews instantly and transparently via mobile money, making the "Fix It" phase fast and efficient.

### 3.2 Water Utility Data Availability
**Score: 4 (Data exists, some form of digital maps, billing records, etc.)**
The National Water and Sewerage Corporation is not starting from a purely analog or paper-based position. The utility has made significant investments in digital systems over the years, creating a solid data foundation upon which the "living digital twin" can be built. While the data may be siloed or require significant cleaning and integration—as is common in most utilities—the core digital assets exist. This significantly accelerates the "See It" phase of the Water OS package, shifting the primary challenge from digitization to data integration and analysis.

NWSC's digital infrastructure includes several key components. They operate a Geographic Information System (GIS), which provides the essential spatial and network map data.17 They utilize Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, which offer real-time operational data on factors like water pressure and flow from key points in the infrastructure.17 For customer and financial data, NWSC uses a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system and maintains digital billing records through its online e-services portal.17 The utility's strategic plans also highlight a focus on becoming a "SMART utility," with initiatives for in-house meter testing labs and further digitization of workflows.40

This existing data landscape is a significant advantage. It means the initial phase of the pilot will not be spent on the laborious process of digitizing paper maps or manually creating asset registries. Instead, the focus can be on the core Water OS value proposition: accessing, fusing, and analyzing these disparate datasets to generate novel insights into NRW "anomaly hotspots." The presence of these systems indicates an institutional appreciation for the value of data, which will likely make the utility more receptive to a data-driven partnership. This allows Water OS to demonstrate value much more quickly, building trust and momentum early in the pilot project.

## Founder & Operational Feasibility (Weight: 20%)

### 4.1 English as an Accessible Language
**Score: 5 (Widely accessible, language of business)**
There is no significant language barrier for an English-speaking founder operating in Kampala. English is one of Uganda's official languages, inherited from the colonial era, and it serves as the primary language for government, commerce, law, and higher education.

All official communications, websites, and reports from key institutional partners such as the National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC) and the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) are published in English.1 Business and technology news is reported in English, and local tech hubs like Hive Colab list English as a primary language of operation.42 This widespread accessibility is a major operational advantage. It eliminates the costs, complexities, and potential misunderstandings associated with relying on translators for contract negotiations, technical discussions with utility engineers, and day-to-day business operations. A solo founder can engage directly and effectively with all key stakeholders, from government ministers to local tech talent, without a linguistic intermediary.

### 4.2 Founder Logistics (Ease of Doing Business)
**Score: 3 (Moderately favorable, with significant security considerations)**
The operational environment in Kampala presents a mixed picture, requiring a clear distinction between corporate feasibility and personal security. While the business can certainly function, a solo founder must be prepared to navigate a challenging landscape and proactively manage non-trivial personal risks.

From a business perspective, the environment is functional but not without friction. The World Bank's global "Ease of Doing Business" rankings, which last placed Uganda 116th out of 190, have been discontinued.43 More recent, localized data from the Uganda Business Climate Index (UBCI) indicates an environment that is below its full potential but showing signs of optimism. Recurring challenges cited by local firms include multiple taxation, unreliable power supply (with 42% of businesses negatively impacted by a recent utility transition), high interest rates, and competition from the informal sector.45 These are manageable operational hurdles but can introduce delays and increase costs.

On a personal level, the security situation requires significant caution. Governments of Western countries, including the United States, Canada, and Australia, have issued travel advisories urging a "high degree of caution" or "reconsider travel" to Uganda.48 These advisories cite credible threats of terrorism and high rates of violent crime, including armed robbery, home invasions, and sexual assault, particularly in larger cities like Kampala.48 While thousands of expatriates live and work in Kampala safely, this requires a heightened state of awareness and specific security protocols. For a solo founder, this means budgeting for and implementing measures such as secure, vetted accommodation, reliable private transportation (avoiding walking or using public transport at night), and maintaining a low profile. The risk is manageable, but it necessitates a concrete and non-negotiable security plan as part of the operational overhead for the pilot.

### 4.3 Broader Environment (Talent & Ecosystem)
**Score: 4 (Thriving tech hub, strong universities)**
Kampala possesses a rich and growing ecosystem of talent, innovation, and civil society expertise that is highly relevant to both the immediate pilot and the long-term Water OS vision. This environment provides the necessary ingredients to build a sustainable, locally-staffed operation rather than a temporary, expatriate-led project.

The city is home to a vibrant technology and startup scene. Prominent tech hubs such as The Innovation Village and Hive Colab serve as nexuses for entrepreneurs, developers, investors, and mentors.42 These hubs provide a direct channel for recruiting local talent, finding potential partners, and integrating into the local business community. They foster a culture of innovation that would be receptive to the Water OS mission.

The talent pipeline is anchored by Makerere University, one of Africa's oldest and most prestigious universities.52 Critically, its strengths are not limited to generic computer science or business degrees. The university has specific research programs and departments focused on water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), climate change, and environmental management.52 This creates a source of highly specialized talent with both technical skills and deep contextual knowledge of Uganda's environmental challenges. Collaborating with the university could also provide research partnerships to help validate and refine the Water OS models.

Finally, there is a strong and well-established civil society sector focused on water and sanitation. Organizations like WaterAid Uganda have been operating in the country for decades and have deep experience working in Kampala's informal settlements.54 The Uganda Water and Sanitation NGO Network (UWASNET) serves as a national coordinating body for these organizations.56 This network is an invaluable resource for gaining on-the-ground intelligence about community dynamics, real-world water access challenges, and potential implementation partners. This ecosystem provides all the components needed to establish Kampala not just as a pilot customer, but as a strategic regional hub for future expansion.
