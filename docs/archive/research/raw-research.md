## 🌍 Today's Rough Breakdown (2020s)

- **Conventional surface & groundwater:** ~70–75% of potable supply.
- **Desalination:** ~1% globally, but >50% in Gulf states.
- **Reclaimed wastewater:** ~2–3% globally (Israel/California lead at >30%).
- **Glaciers/iceberg towing:** negligible, mostly experimental.
- **Other innovations (atmospheric water capture, fog nets, dew harvesting, etc.):** negligible, niche.

*This is not sustainable: groundwater overpumping, rivers drying, and only a sliver of circularity.*

## 🔮 30-Year Optimized Portfolio (2055-ish)

### Conventional freshwater (surface + groundwater): ~40–45%
- Still important, but drastically reduced reliance.
- Managed aquifers, better watershed conservation.
- **Tech:** IoT monitoring, leakage reduction, precision irrigation.
- **Limits:** finite and climate-stressed.

### Desalination: ~25–30%
- Grows significantly as costs fall (solar + advanced membranes).
- Likely clustered near coasts and powered by renewables.
- **Tech:** AI-optimized RO, nanomaterials, solar thermal hybrids.
- **Bottleneck:** energy use and brine disposal — but solvable.

### Reclaimed wastewater: ~20–25%
- Circularity becomes the norm in cities.
- "Toilet-to-tap" direct potable reuse accepted worldwide.
- **Tech:** advanced oxidation, AI-driven sensors for quality assurance.
- **Benefit:** urban populations make this highly scalable.

### "Locked sources" (glaciers, icebergs, deep aquifers): ~2–5%
- Likely limited, boutique or emergency use.
- Melting glaciers will release water anyway, but logistics + geopolitics + ecological impact make large-scale "iceberg towing" niche.
- Deep fossil aquifers tapped in dry regions, but as a last resort.

### Other / Emerging (atmospheric capture, fog nets, cloud seeding, synthetic biology): ~5–8%
- Atmospheric Water Generators (AWGs) already work off-grid — could serve arid but sunny zones at community level.
- Fog harvesting scaled in coastal deserts (Chile, Morocco).
- Cloud seeding + weather modification remain geopolitically sensitive but technically viable.
- Synthetic biology: crops engineered to excrete potable water, or microbes used in purification.

## 🌧️ Global Rainfall Statistics

### 1. Global Rainfall Volume
- **Average annual global precipitation:** ~990 mm (1 meter) of rain per square meter.
- **Earth's land area:** ≈ 149 million km².
- **So, rainfall on land** = \(149 \times 10^6 \text{ km}^2 \times 1 \text{ m} \approx 150,000 \text{ km}^3\)
- **Global average precipitation:** ~110,000–120,000 km³/year (FAO/UNESCO values), of which ~110,000 km³ falls on land and the rest on oceans.

👉 Think of that as ~110 trillion cubic meters of freshwater raining on land every year.

### 2. How Much Is "Captured" or Usable?
Out of that rainfall, most returns to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration.

**FAO estimates:**
- **65% (≈ 71,000 km³)** evaporates or transpires back almost immediately.
- **35% (≈ 40,000 km³)** becomes "renewable freshwater resources" (runoff + groundwater recharge).

So only about 1/3 of land rainfall is "captured" into rivers, lakes, and aquifers.

### 3. How Much Do Humans Use?
- **Global human freshwater withdrawals:** ≈ 4,000 km³/year (irrigation, industry, domestic).
- That's ~10% of the renewable freshwater flow (≈ 40,000 km³).
- But withdrawals are not evenly distributed → some basins (e.g., Indus, Murray-Darling, Colorado) are massively overdrawn, while others are scarcely tapped.

### 📊 Summary
- **Global precipitation on land:** ~110,000 km³/year.
- **Captured as rivers/lakes/groundwater:** ~40,000 km³/year (~35%).
- **Human withdrawals:** ~4,000 km³/year (~10% of renewable supply, ~3–4% of total land rainfall).

## 💧 Water OS Revenue Model: 1M-Person City Analysis

### 1. Estimate water demand & supply in a 1M-person city

**Per capita need (assumption):** 150 L/day.

**Annual demand:**
1,000,000 × 150 L/day × 365 ≈ 54.75 billion liters/year

### 2. Model current losses

**NRW = 35%**

- **Lost water** = 0.35 × 54.75B L ≈ **19.2B L**
- **Billed/usable** = 0.65 × 54.75B L ≈ **35.6B L**

### 3. Model improved losses

**Target NRW = 20%**

- **Billed share** = 0.80 × 54.75B L ≈ **43.8B L**

### 4. Additional water captured (the "recovered" volume)

43.8B - 35.6B ≈ **8.2B L**

So, if you move from 35% → 20% NRW, you effectively recover ~8.2 billion liters/year of billable water.

### 5. Revenue from recovered water

**Typical piped water tariff** in Nairobi/Kampala/Accra = $0.70–$1.20 per m³ (1,000 L).

So, revenue per recovered 1,000 L = ~$0.70–$1.20.

8.2B L = 8.2M m³

- **At $0.70/m³** → **$5.7M/year**
- **At $1.20/m³** → **$9.8M/year**

### 6. Your SaaS "slice" (10% of recovered revenue)

**10% of $5.7M–$9.8M = $0.6M – $1.0M per year**

That's the net annual revenue potential per 1M-person city if you help the utility reduce NRW from ~35% → ~20%.

### 🔑 Strategic Insight

This validates that NRW reduction via mapping + data integration is a high-value, software-driven wedge.

For a 1M city, the order of magnitude is ~$0.5M–$1M/year in take-home potential per utility.

At scale (say, 50 cities × $0.5–1M = $25–50M recurring revenue), you're looking at real "venture-scale" traction, before even expanding into source diversification or last-mile marketplaces.

## 🏛️ Real-World Performance-Based Contracts (PBCs) for NRW Reduction

### 1. Madaba, Jordan (Micro-PSP model)

A private operator (Engicon) was contracted under a performance-based structure.

**Outcomes:**
- NRW dropped from **45% to 34%**
- Revenue collections nearly doubled (from 0.9M to 1.9M local currency units)

**Payment details:** All revenue still went to the utility; the model incentivized performance indirectly without a revenue-share cut.

### 2. DWASA, Dhaka, Bangladesh

Introduced a computerized billing system and privatized billing operations.

**Achievements (2010–2013):**
- Billing efficiency substantially improved
- NRW fell from **36% to 27%**

**Payment model:** Incentivized through performance bonuses and governance improvements — not a direct revenue share, but still outcome-aligned.

### 3. NWSC, Uganda

Implemented internal performance contracts with management — bonuses tied to NRW reduction.

**Example goal:** Reduce NRW from **39% to 36%** over a three-year term.

**No third-party revenue-share;** it was internal incentive-based.

### 4. Phnom Penh, Cambodia

Public utility reduced NRW dramatically from **72% to 6%** between 1993 and 2008.

**Likely funded** via traditional public investment and internal utility reform—not through external PBCs.

### 5. Manila Water, East Manila

NRW dropped from **63% to 16%** over a decade-long concession period.

They operated under a **concession model**, with embedded incentives in their business structure—not a direct percentage share of saved water but strong alignment through regulation and profit structures.

### What These Examples Reveal

| Model Type | NRW Improvement | Payment Structure |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Madaba, Jordan | ~11 percentage points | Private operator, no direct share of revenue |
| Dhaka, Bangladesh | ~9 percentage points | Internal billing reform bonuses |
| NWSC, Uganda | ~3 percentage points | Internal management bonuses |
| Phnom Penh, Cambodia | ~66 percentage points | State reforms + internal public funding |
| Manila, Philippines (East) | ~47 percentage points | Concession model aligns incentives |

### Key Insights:

- **Third-party PBCs typically do not involve an explicit revenue-share** from recovered water
- Instead, models focus on **fixed fees, bonuses, and performance incentives** structured through contracts
- **Concession models** (like Manila) align utility profitability with NRW reduction
- **Internal incentives** (Uganda, Dhaka) motivate management but don't involve external partners claiming a share

### What This Means for Your Model

**10% revenue share is not typical**, but the concept of performance-based compensation is proven and accepted.

Your model—**10% of the value of recovered water**—could be viable as a value-capture innovation, especially if:

- You ensure that the **financial uplift is clearly measured and verified**
- Utilities are unable to self-finance or quickly implement large capex changes
- You're providing **highly differentiated value** via mapping + analytics, not just hardware

### Verdict

A **10% share of recovered water revenue** is on the higher side but not implausible if you clearly deliver and structure it as:

- A **performance-based, results-driven SaaS**
- An **augmentation of utility capacity**, not a competing service
- A **partner in financing outcomes**, with risk share and verification baked in

*Would you like me to model a blended approach where your share is a fixed fee + tiered variable bonus—to align more closely with real-world PBC structures but still retain upside for you?*
