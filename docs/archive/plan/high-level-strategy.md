# Water OS: The NRW Recovery & Resilience Business Plan

## 1. Executive Summary

Water OS is a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) created to solve the global water crisis by ensuring that every household has direct, reliable access to potable water. Our strategy combines digital intelligence and physical systems into one operating platform for water.

Today, **2.1 billion people** lack safely managed water in their homes. Utilities in emerging cities lose **30–50%** of treated water as Non-Revenue Water (NRW), mostly because **40–60%** of their pipe networks are unmapped. Without visibility, utilities operate blind: leaks go undetected, illegal taps proliferate, and billing breaks down. The result is catastrophic waste of treated water, energy, and money — while households remain dry.

Our solution is an end-to-end partnership: **The NRW Recovery & Resilience Package**. We don't just show utilities their problems; we become their partner to find, fix, and finance water losses, with zero upfront cost. This turn-key, performance-based service is designed to deliver a minimum 10-15% reduction in NRW within 18-24 months by moving utilities from a state of blindness to one of control and recovery. This proven foundation unlocks our long-term vision of universal water access.

## 2. Company Description

**Name:** Water OS

**Legal Structure:** Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) — embedding mission in governance while enabling scale through profit.

**Mission:** Ensure every household in the world has reliable access to potable water by orchestrating digital and physical water systems.

**Vision:** To become the global operating system for water — connecting sources, utilities, distributors, and households to eliminate waste and guarantee safety.

**Founder Profile:** Solo founder with deep expertise in AI, software, and systems design. Initial strategy leverages low-capex, digital-first pilots to prove value before heavy investment.

## 3. The Problem: A System Flying Blind

- **NRW Crisis:** Utilities lose 30–50% of treated water before it reaches households.
- **Blind Infrastructure:** 40–60% of pipe networks are unmapped. Utilities cannot manage what they cannot see.
- **Ineffective Legacy Solutions:** Industrial incumbents (Siemens, Veolia, etc.) require millions in CapEx, assume 24/7 pressurization, and depend on clean maps — conditions absent in emerging cities.
- **Household Impact:** Because bulk supply is unreliable, families buy from tankers/vendors at 10–20x the piped price. Women and children spend 200 million hours daily fetching water, often at personal risk.

## 4. The Solution: The NRW Recovery & Resilience Package

We have reimagined our initial offering not as a mere proof point, but as a complete, irresistible product for a utility. The core philosophy shifts from "We'll show you where you're losing water" to **"We will become your end-to-end partner to find, fix, and finance your water losses, with zero upfront cost to you."**

This is a turn-key, performance-based service designed to deliver a minimum 10-15% reduction in NRW within 18-24 months. It is composed of three integrated deliverables.

### Deliverable 1: The Living Digital Twin & Anomaly Hotspots (Months 1-3)

This is the **"See It"** stage. We solve the "blind infrastructure" problem by deploying our "Chaos Interpreter" AI. It fuses every piece of data the utility has (and data they don't)—from hand-drawn maps and billing records to satellite imagery—into a single source of truth.

**The utility gets:**
- **The First Coherent Network Map:** A dynamic, "good enough" digital twin of their known and inferred network.
- **A Quantified NRW Baseline:** A data-backed estimate of their total water losses, breaking down probable physical vs. commercial losses.
- **Prioritized Anomaly Hotspots:** An interactive treasure map showing them exactly where their biggest losses are.

### Deliverable 2: The Actionability Diagnostic (Months 4-9)

This is the **"Understand It"** stage. We solve the "why can't we fix it?" problem by moving from digital inference to precise physical validation. We deploy a handful of low-cost IoT sensors in the top hotspots and work with utility crews to track leak response.

**The utility gets:**
- **A Verified Leak Registry:** A live list of confirmed, significant leaks, with estimated liters/day being lost at each site.
- **The Bottleneck Dashboard:** A real-time analysis of why repairs are not happening, categorizing pending repairs by their root cause: Financial, Capacity, Supply Chain, or Political/Administrative.

### Deliverable 3: The Recovery Action Platform (Months 10-24)

This is the **"Fix It"** stage. We actively help solve the bottlenecks we've diagnosed by providing integrated software and financial tools.

**What we provide:**
- **To solve Capacity Bottlenecks:** A simple mobile dispatch tool for crew managers to optimize scheduling and routing.
- **To solve Financial Bottlenecks:** The Water OS Recovery Fund. We partner with impact investors to facilitate on-demand micro-loans for high-ROI repairs, bypassing slow budget cycles.

**The utility gets:**
- **Integrated Repair Logistics:** A simple system to manage and track repair jobs from detection to completion.
- **On-Demand Repair Financing:** The ability to fund high-value leaks with a single click.
- **A Verified Savings Ledger:** Transparent, trusted accounting of every liter of water recovered.
- **A Public Transparency Dashboard:** A tool to share progress with citizens, building trust and political capital.

## 5. Go-to-Market Strategy & Pitch

Our go-to-market strategy remains focused on a pilot-based approach to prove value and build a repeatable playbook.

### Pilot Funnel
**Broad Analysis (12–15 Cities):** Desk research to score cities on unmet demand, digital rails, operating risk, and competition.

**Pilot Deployments (1–3 Utilities):** Deploy the full NRW Recovery & Resilience Package.

**Comparative Playbook:** Document which archetypes (fragmented, government-led, hybrid) are most successful to standardize the expansion model.

### The Pitch to a Mayor or Utility Director
*"Mayor, you're losing nearly half of your city's treated water, which costs you millions in revenue and forces you to ration supply to your citizens. You know you have underground leaks, but you don't have the visibility to find them or the budget to fix them all.*

*We offer a Recovery & Resilience partnership at zero risk to you.*

*In 90 days, we will give you a digital map of your network and pinpoint the exact locations of your largest financial losses. Then, we will work with your teams to diagnose the real bottlenecks—be it money, manpower, or materials—that prevent repairs.*

*Finally, we will provide you with the software and even the on-demand financing to fix those leaks.*

*You only pay us a small share of the new revenue you recover. You start saving money from day one, your citizens get more reliable water, and you get the credit for starting the journey to 24/7 supply. Shall we begin?"*

## 6. Project Roadmap (18-24 Months)

The NRW Recovery & Resilience Package is deployed over an 18 to 24-month period, structured around our three key deliverables.

- **Months 1-3 (See It):** Deliver the Living Digital Twin and Anomaly Hotspots. Establish a quantified NRW baseline.
- **Months 4-9 (Understand It):** Deploy targeted sensors and deliver the Actionability Diagnostic, identifying core bottlenecks.
- **Months 10-24 (Fix It):** Launch the Recovery Action Platform, providing logistics tools and on-demand financing to systematically resolve bottlenecks and reduce NRW.

**Success Metric:** Verified reduction of NRW by ≥10-15% in pilots, a clear financial return for the utility, and measurable improvement in household supply hours/days.

## 7. Financial Plan & Projections

**Revenue Model:** Our model is designed to remove risk and build trust with our utility partners.
- **Zero Upfront Fee:** This is non-negotiable. Utilities pay nothing to begin the partnership.
- **Performance-Based Share:** We take a 10-15% share of the verified monetary value of all recovered water. This is our primary revenue driver.
- **(Future) Financing Fee:** As we scale the Recovery Fund, we may take a small percentage on the repair capital we facilitate, creating a second revenue stream.

### Example – City of 1M people

- **Per capita demand:** 150 L/day → 54.75M m³/year.
- **NRW reduction:** 15 percentage points (35% → 20%).
- **Annual recovered volume:** 8.2M m³.
- **Average tariff:** $1/m³.
- **Utility value:** $8.2M/year.
- **Water OS revenue (10%):** $820,000 ARR per city.

**Costs:** ~$350,000 per city pilot (satellite data, anomaly model build, minimal IoT, local engagement).

**Margins:** 80–90% gross margin (software-first).

Initial seed capital of ~$1M is required to deploy the package in 2–3 cities and reach profitability.

## 8. Why This is Compelling

This reimagined approach is powerful because it solves the whole problem, not just a piece of it.
- **Zero Upfront Risk:** It completely removes the primary barrier to adoption for cash-strapped utilities.
- **From Data to Action:** It delivers outcomes, not just data. We are a partner in recovery, not just another vendor.
- **Unlocks New Capital:** The on-demand financing is a game-changer. It turns NRW from a budget-draining problem into a self-funding recovery opportunity.
- **Creates a Politically Positive Narrative:** It gives city leaders tangible, verifiable proof of progress to share with the public, building trust and political capital.
