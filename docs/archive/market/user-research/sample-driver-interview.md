## Full Transcript

**Interviewer:** Thanks for taking the time to speak with me today. Can you tell me about your water delivery business?

**Participant:** Yes, I've been doing this for 8 years now. I started with one truck and now I have three. Business is good, especially during dry season.

**Interviewer:** What does a typical day look like for you?

**Participant:** I wake up around 5am, check my WhatsApp messages for bookings. Then I send my drivers to the depot. Sometimes we wait there for 2, 3, even 4 hours before we can fill up. That's the biggest problem.

**Interviewer:** Tell me more about the depot waits. Why does it take so long?

**Participant:** Too many trucks, not enough water stations. During peak times, maybe 20, 30 trucks are waiting. Some depots are worse than others. I wish I knew before I sent my driver which depot has short queue.

**Interviewer:** How do you currently find out about depot queues?

**Participant:** I call my driver friends, they tell me where they are. Sometimes they lie because they don't want competition! [laughs] It's not a good system.

**Interviewer:** Let's talk about your customers. How do they find you?

**Participant:** Mostly WhatsApp and word of mouth. I have maybe 150 regular customers. They message me, I tell them price, they say yes or no.

**Interviewer:** Do customers ever cancel on you?

**Participant:** Oh yes, all the time! Maybe 15% of bookings. They call 2, 3 drivers at same time. Whoever arrives first gets the sale. Sometimes I drive 30 minutes and they already bought from someone else. That's very frustrating.

**Interviewer:** How do you handle pricing?

**Participant:** It depends on distance. Nearby customers pay 350 cedis for 1,000 liters. Far customers, maybe 500 cedis. If there's bad traffic, I charge extra for fuel.

**Interviewer:** Do customers ever complain about surprise fees?

**Participant:** Sometimes, yes. But I explain - traffic means more fuel, more time. Most understand.

**Interviewer:** How do customers pay you?

**Participant:** Most pay cash on delivery. Some I know well, they pay later. Some use mobile money but the fees are high - 1-2%. I prefer cash.

**Interviewer:** Do you ever have trouble collecting payment?

**Participant:** Yes, some customers take weeks to pay. One customer still owes me from 2 months ago. But I can't refuse them - they're regular customers.

**Interviewer:** Have you ever used any apps for your business? Like Uber or logistics apps?

**Participant:** No, I don't use those things. Just WhatsApp. I'm not very good with technology.

**Interviewer:** What if there was an app that could help you see depot queues in real-time, so you know where to go?

**Participant:** That would be very helpful! Save so much time. But would depot owners share that information?

**Interviewer:** What if the app could also send you confirmed bookings where the customer already paid, so no cancellations?

**Participant:** [Eyes light up] That would be amazing! No more wasted trips. But the customer would pay less, right? Because you take commission?

**Interviewer:** Potentially, yes. Would you accept slightly lower payment per delivery if you could do more deliveries per day with less wasted time?

**Participant:** Hmm... maybe. If I can do 2, 3 more deliveries per day, then yes, that could work. Time is money.

**Interviewer:** What about route planning? Do you plan your routes?

**Participant:** Yes, every morning. I look at my bookings and try to group them by area. But sometimes I make mistakes - I go to Spintex first, then Cantonments, then back to Spintex. Wastes fuel.

**Interviewer:** Would you want help planning the most efficient routes?

**Participant:** Yes, that would be good. But I know the roads better than any computer! Some roads are too narrow for my truck. Computer doesn't know that.

**Interviewer:** That's a good point. What if you could see the suggested route and change it based on your local knowledge?

**Participant:** Oh yes, that would work. Give me suggestion, I can adjust.

**Interviewer:** Last question - what's your biggest challenge in this business?

**Participant:** [Thinks for a moment] The depot waits. If I could solve that, I could make 50% more money. Right now, my trucks sit empty for 3-4 hours per day. That's lost income.

**Interviewer:** Thank you so much for your time and insights.

**Participant:** You're welcome. If you build this app, let me know. I want to try it.

## Follow-up Items
- [x] Get contact info for potential beta testing
- [ ] Ask about specific depot preferences in next interview
- [ ] Validate 15% cancellation rate with other drivers
- [ ] Quantify exact time savings needed to justify lower per-delivery rate

## Notes
- Very receptive to platform concept
- Main concern is depot cooperation (data sharing)
- Needs to see clear ROI (more deliveries/day) to accept lower rates
- Not tech-savvy but willing to learn if value is clear
- Depot wait time is #1 pain point (8/10 severity)
